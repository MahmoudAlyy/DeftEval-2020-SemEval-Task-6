 sometimes   evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other  	0
 when two species evolve in diverse directions from  common point   it is called divergent evolution  	1
 such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies   however   they can look very different as  result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators <link>  	0
 flowering plants evolved from  common ancestor  	0
 some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all   and appear to be residual parts from  past common ancestor  	1
 these unused structures without function are called vestigial structures  	0
 other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds   leaves on some cacti   and hind leg bones in whales  	0
 for example   even though bald eagles   haliaeetus leucocephalus   and african fish eagles   haliaeetus vocifer   are both birds and eagles   each belongs to  separate species group <link>  	0
 if humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of  bald eagle with the sperm of an african fish eagle and  chick did hatch   that offspring   called  hybrid    cross between two species     would probably be infertile   unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity  	1
 different species may have different genes that are active in development   therefore   it may not be possible to develop  viable offspring with two different sets of directions  	0
 allopatric speciation   allo    	1
 sympatric speciation   sym    	1
 reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed  	1
 in some cases    polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in  condition called autopolyploidy <link>  	1
 the prefix   auto    means   self     so the term means multiple chromosomes from one   own species  	1
 recall that  zygote is  fertilized egg   the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually  	1
 therefore    prezygotic barrier is  mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place   this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction  	1
  postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation   this includes organisms that do   survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile  	0
 in some cases   populations of  species move or are moved to  new habitat and take up residence in  place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species  	1
 this situation is called habitat isolation  	0
 reproduction with the parent species ceases   and  new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent  	0
 hybrid individuals in many cases can not form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages  	1
 this is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable  	0
 in another postzygotic situation   reproduction leads to the birth and growth of  hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own   this is called hybrid sterility  	1
 heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences   or genetic variance   among individuals in  population  	1
 the greater the hereditability of  population   phenotypic variation   the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation  	0
 while it is likely to happen at some point   it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population   and as  result   the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool  	0
 however   if  family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other   this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring    phenomenon known as inbreeding depression  	1
 genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events   such as  natural disaster that kills   at random    large portion of the population  	0
 known as the bottleneck effect   it results in  large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out <link>  	1
 in one fell swoop   the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population   which may be very different from the pre   disaster population  	0
 traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection  	0
 one common form of mate choice   called assortative mating   is an individual   preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves  	1
 natural selection only acts on the population   heritable traits   selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population   while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequency    process known as adaptive evolution  	1
 natural selection does not act on individual alleles   however   but on entire organisms  	0
 if natural selection favors an average phenotype   selecting against extreme variation   the population will undergo stabilizing selection <link>  	1
 in  population of mice that live in the woods   for example   natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators  	0
 another type of selection   called frequency   dependent selection   favors phenotypes that are either common   positive frequency   dependent selection   or rare   negative frequency   dependent selection    	1
 an interesting example of this type of selection is seen in  unique group of lizards of the pacific northwest  	0
 the good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease  	1
 females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority   which they will then pass on to their offspring  	0
 scientists use  tool called  phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms  	0
  phylogenetic tree is  diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms  	1
 scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be  hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one can not go back to confirm the proposed relationships  	0
 the point where  split occurs   called  branch point   represents where  single lineage evolved into  distinct new one  	1
  lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon  	1
 when two lineages stem from the same branch point   they are called sister taxa  	1
 many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time   these disciplines together contribute to building   updating   and maintaining the   tree of life   information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in  scientific field called systematics  	0
 data may be collected from fossils   from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism   and by dna analysis  	0
 within each domain is  second category called  kingdom  	1
 after kingdoms   the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are   phylum   class   order   family   genus   and species <link>  	0
 this usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions  	0
 when similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to  close evolutionary relationship   it is called an analogy or homoplasy  	1
 for example   insects use wings to fly like bats and birds   but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different  	0
 to aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately   scientists often use  concept called maximum parsimony   which means that events occurred in the simplest   most obvious way  	1
 for example   if  group of people entered  forest preserve to go hiking   based on the principle of maximum parsimony   one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones  	0
 the mitochondria   first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in  prokaryotic host     link      which subsequently acquired  nucleus   by fusion or other mechanisms   to become the first eukaryotic cell  	1
 most interestingly   the eukaryote   first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity     link     	1
 all of these hypotheses are testable  	0

 the viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell   which may cause cell damage  	1
 these changes   called cytopathic   causing cell damage   effects   can change cell functions or even destroy the cell  	0
 some infected cells   such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus   die through lysis   bursting   or apoptosis   programmed cell death or   cell suicide       releasing all progeny virions at once  	1
 when infection of  cell by  bacteriophage results in the production of new virions   the infection is said to be productive  	1
 if the virions are released by bursting the cell   the virus replicates by means of  lytic cycle <link>  	0
 an example of  lytic bacteriophage is <chem>   which infects escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract  	0
 an example is the animal herpesviruses   including herpes simplex viruses   the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans  	0
 in  process called latency   these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions   only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates  	1
 even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency   the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages  	0
 examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza  	0
 other viruses cause long   term chronic infections   such as the virus causing hepatitis    whereas others   like herpes simplex virus   only cause intermittent symptoms  	0
 still other viruses   such as human herpesviruses <num> and <num>   which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola   often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host   and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection  	1
 plant viruses can be transmitted by  variety of vectors   through contact with an infected plant   sap   by living organisms such as insects and nematodes   and through pollen  	1
 when plants viruses are transferred between different plants   this is known as horizontal transmission   and when they are inherited from  parent   this is called vertical transmission  	1

 the danger of using live vaccines   which are usually more effective than killed vaccines   is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease   causing form by back mutations  	0
 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating   weakening   the   wild   type     disease   causing   virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host  	1
 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating   weakening   the   wild   type     disease   causing   virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host  	1
 adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus   allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host  	0
 the use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them  	0
 although phage therapy is in use in the republic of georgia to treat antibiotic   resistant bacteria   its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries  	0
 however   the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the united states when the us food and drug administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen listeria  	0

 to understand how elements come together   we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element   the atom  	0
 an atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element  	0
 for example   one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is  solid metal at room temperature  	0
 therefore   the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass   but not to its charge  	0
 electrons are much smaller in mass than protons   weighing only <num>   <num>   <num> grams   or about <num>   <num> of an atomic mass unit  	0
 hence   they do not contribute much to an element   overall atomic mass  	0
 this approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number  	0
 since an element   isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers   scientists also determine the atomic mass   which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes  	0
 often   the resulting number contains  fraction  	0
 the different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table  	0
 devised by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev   <num>   <num>   in <num>   the table groups elements that   although unique   share certain chemical properties with other elements  	0
 an early model of the atom was developed in <num> by danish scientist niels bohr   <num>   <num>    	0
 the bohr model shows the atom as  central nucleus containing protons and neutrons   with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus   as illustrated in <link>  	0
 these orbits form electron shells or energy levels   which are  way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells  	0
 hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration   while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable  	0
 as  result of losing  negatively charged electron   they become positively charged ions  	0
 group <num> elements   including fluorine and chlorine   have seven electrons in their outmost shells   so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules   making them negatively charged ions  	0
 this is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable  	0
 however   since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells   atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain  stable electron configuration  	0
 when two or more atoms chemically bond with each other   the resultant chemical structure is  molecule  	0
 in the equation below   the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules  	0
 this is an example of  balanced chemical equation   wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation  	1
 according to the law of conservation of matter   the number of atoms before and after  chemical reaction should be equal   such that no atoms are   under normal circumstances   created or destroyed  	1
 the equations that describe these reactions contain  unidirectional arrow and are irreversible  	0
 reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction  	0
 in reversible reactions   reactants are turned into products   but when the concentration of product goes beyond  certain threshold   characteristic of the particular reaction     some of these products will be converted back into reactants   at this point   the designations of products and reactants are reversed  	0
 because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons   each ion has  net charge  	0
 cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons  	1
 negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions  	1
 ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges  	1
 for instance   positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride   or table salt   creating  crystalline molecule with zero net charge  	0
 there are two types of covalent bonds   polar and nonpolar  	0
 in  polar covalent bond   shown in <link>   the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other  	1
 because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements    slightly positive        or slightly negative         charge develops  	0
 when this happens    weak interaction occurs between the   of the hydrogen from one molecule and the     charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule   usually oxygen or nitrogen   or within the same molecule  	1
 this interaction is called  hydrogen bond  	0
 this type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules  	0
 in contrast   non   polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water   as shown in <link> and separate from it rather than dissolve in it   as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar   an acidic water solution    	1
 these nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic   hydro      water      phobic     fearing      	0
 water also has  high heat of vaporization   the amount of energy required to change one gram of  liquid substance to  gas  	1
  considerable amount of heat energy   <num> cal   is required to accomplish this change in water  	0
 the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water   surrounding the particle with water molecules  	1
 this is referred to as  sphere of hydration   or  hydration shell   as illustrated in <link> and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water  	0
 when ionic compounds are added to water   the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation  	0
 dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions  	1
 these cohesive forces are related to water   property of adhesion   or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules  	1
 this attraction is sometimes stronger than water   cohesive forces   especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes  	0
 using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers   high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield  low ph number   whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in  high ph  	0
 an acid is  substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions       in  solution   usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate  	1
  base provides either hydroxide ions   oh     or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions   reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the ph  	1
 buffers are the key  	0
 buffers readily absorb excess   or oh     keeping the ph of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival  	1
 maintaining  constant blood ph is critical to  person   well   being  	0

 another type of hydrocarbon   aromatic hydrocarbons   consists of closed rings of carbon atoms  	1
 molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement   structure   of their atoms and or chemical bonds are known as isomers  	1
 structural isomers   like butane and isobutene shown in <link>    differ in the placement of their covalent bonds   both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens   <chem>     but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties  	1
 for example   due to their different chemical properties   butane is suited for use as  fuel for cigarette lighters and torches   whereas isobutene is suited for use as  refrigerant and  propellant in spray cans  	0

 the monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers  	1
 dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed   or   sped up     by specific enzymes   dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds   requiring energy   while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy  	1
 these reactions are similar for most macromolecules   but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class  	0

 omega <num> fatty acids   like that shown in <link>   fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans   the other being omega <num> fatty acid    	0
 these are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega <num> because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by  double bond  	0
 unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier   steroids have  fused ring structure  	0

 only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones   or chaperonins   that associate with the target protein during the folding process  	1
 they act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure   and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded  	0

  ligand is  molecule that binds another specific molecule   in some cases   delivering  signal in the process  	1
 signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals  	1
 paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix  	0
 when these impulses reach the end of the axon   the signal continues on to  dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell   the cell emitting the signal    	0
 the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells   which are called chemical synapses <link>  	1
 the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly   this enables an immediate response   such as   take your hand off the stove  	0
 gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells  	1
 these water   filled channels allow small signaling molecules   called intracellular mediators   to diffuse between the two cells  	0
 small molecules   such as calcium ions   <chem>       are able to move between cells   but large molecules like proteins and dna can not fit through the channels  	0

 enzyme   linked receptors are cell   surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme  	1
 in some cases   the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme  	0
 in some cases   binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor   which means that two receptors bind to each other to form  stable complex called  dimer  	1
  dimer is  chemical compound formed when two molecules   often identical   join together  	1
 the binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other  	0

 at the center of each animal cell   the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with  pair of rod   like objects   the centrioles   which are at right angles to each other  	1
 the mitotic phase is  multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned   separated   and move into two new   identical daughter cells  	1
 the first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis   or nuclear division  	1

 the sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins  	0
 cytokinesis   or   cell motion     is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells  	1
 division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells  	0
 not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which  newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase   closely followed by the mitotic phase  	0
 cells in <chem> phase are not actively preparing to divide  	0
 the cell is in  quiescent   inactive   stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle  	1

 in species such as humans   even though the  and  sex chromosomes are not homologous   most of their genes differ     they have  small region of homology that allows the  and  chromosomes to pair up during prophase   	0
  partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology  	0
 following crossover   the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed  	0
 at the end of prophase    the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata <link> and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible  	1
 fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles  	0
 what happens between these two events depends on the organism  	0
 species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle  	0
 the haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes   because they produce gametes from specialized cells  	1
 meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case   because the organism that produces the gametes is already  haploid  	0
 in <num>   he published his work   experiments in plant hybridization   <num> in the proceedings of the natural history society of br nn  	0
 mendel   work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed   incorrectly   that the process of inheritance involved  blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring   this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation  	0
 continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine  characteristic like human height  	1
 offspring appear to be    blend   of their parents   traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation  	0
 mendel performed hybridizations   which involve mating two true   breeding individuals that have different traits  	1
 in the pea   which is naturally self   pollinating   this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of  mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of  separate mature pea plant of the second variety  	0
 once mendel examined the characteristics in the <chem> generation of plants   he allowed them to self   fertilize naturally  	0
 he then collected and grew the seeds from the <chem> plants to produce the <chem>   or second filial   generation  	0
 mendel   experiments extended beyond the <chem> generation to the <chem> and <chem> generations   and so on   but it was the ratio of characteristics in the <chem>   <chem>   <chem> generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for mendel   postulates in one of his experiments on inheritance patterns   mendel crossed plants that were true   breeding for violet flower color with plants true   breeding for white flower color   the  generation    	0
 he called these   respectively   dominant and recessive traits  	0
 dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in  hybridization  	1

 on the other hand   the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway  	0
 the sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event   of two mutually exclusive events   is the sum of their individual probabilities  	1
 the observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype  	1
 an organism   underlying genetic makeup   consisting of both physically visible and non   expressed alleles   is called its genotype  	1

 of course   doing  test cross in humans is unethical and impractical  	0
 instead   geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases <link>  	0
 although individual humans   and all diploid organisms   can only have two alleles for  given gene   multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed  	0
 note that when many alleles exist for the same gene   the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type   often abbreviated           this is considered the standard or norm  	1
 all other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard   meaning that they deviate from the wild type  	0
 although the  chromosome contains  small region of similarity to the  chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis   the  chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes  	0
 when  gene being examined is present on the  chromosome   but not on the  chromosome   it is said to be    linked  	1
 for instance   the recessive lethal curly allele in drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote  	0
  single copy of the wild   type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival  	0
 the dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote   this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age  	1
 individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form  	0
 mendel   law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes   and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur  	1
 the independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross    cross between two true   breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics  	0
 in epistasis   the interaction between genes is antagonistic   such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another  	1
   epistasis   is  word composed of greek roots that mean   standing upon  	0
 the alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking  	0
 if the genes are unlinked   the individual should produce ab   ab   ab   and ab gametes with equal frequencies   according to the mendelian concept of independent assortment  	1
 because they correspond to new allele combinations   the genotypes ab and ab are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis  	1
 parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents  	1
 such  result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked   but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur  	0
 sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units   or centimorgans   cm     in which  recombination frequency of <num> corresponds to <num> cm by representing alleles in  linear map   sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked   recombination frequency   <num>   to being perfectly unlinked   recombination frequency   <num>   when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome  	1

 an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid    term that includes monosomy   loss of one chromosome   or trisomy   gain of an extraneous chromosome    	1
 rather than  gain or loss of autosomes   variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects  	0
 in part   this occurs because of  molecular process called  inactivation  	0
 early in development   when female mammalian embryos consist of just  few thousand cells   relative to trillions in the newborn     one  chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into  quiescent   dormant   structure called  barr body  	1

 instructions on dna are transcribed onto messenger rna  	0
 ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on  strand of messenger rna and use this information to string amino acids together into  protein  	1
 these nucleotide triplets are called codons  	1
 the insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame   thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid <link>  	0
 though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation   the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained  	0
 plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance transcription in prokaryotes   and in eukaryotes   requires the dna double helix to partially unwind in the region of mrna synthesis  	0
 the region of unwinding is called  transcription bubble  	1
 transcription always proceeds from the same dna strand for each gene   which is called the template strand  	1
 the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand   called the nontemplate strand  	1
 the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first <num>   mrna nucleotide is transcribed is called the  <num> site   or the initiation site  	1
 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream  	0

 the polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme  	1
 one is protein   based and the other is rna   based  	0
 rho   dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein   which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mrna chain  	1

 many eukaryotic mrnas are translated from the first aug   but this is not always the case  	0
 according to kozak   rules   the nucleotides around the aug indicate whether it is the correct start codon  	1
 kozak   rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the aug of vertebrate genes   <num>     gcc rcc aug  <num>    	0
 usually   this is because the mrna is missing several  nucleotides  	0
 the cell performs an additional rna processing step called rna editing to remedy this  	0
 eukaryotic genes are composed of exons   which correspond to protein   coding sequences   ex   on signifies that they are expressed     and intervening sequences called introns   int   ron denotes their intervening role     which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre   mrna during processing  	1

 one such sugar source is lactose  	0
 the lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment  	1
 cap binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon  	1

 for example   in experiments performed on the garden pea   it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant   pollen were linked traits   and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome  	0
 the exchange of dna between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination   which occurs by the crossing over of dna between homologous strands of dna   such as nonsister chromatids  	1
 linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes  	1
 it is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping   but not the exact distance   number of base pairs    	0
 radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation   such as    rays   to break the dna into fragments  	1
 the amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments  	0
  genetic site used to generate  physical map with sequencing technology    sequence   tagged site   or sts   is  unique sequence in the genome with  known exact chromosomal location  	0
 an expressed sequence tag   est   and  single sequence length polymorphism   sslp   are common stss  	0
 the chain termination method involves dna replication of  single   stranded template with the use of  primer and  regular deoxynucleotide   dntp     which is  monomer   or  single unit   of dna  	0
 the primer and dntp are mixed with  small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides   ddntps    	0
 the ddntps are monomers that are missing  hydroxyl group     oh   at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form  chain <link>  	1
 this was sufficient for sequencing small genomes  	0
 however   the desire to sequence larger genomes   such as that of  human   led to the development of double   barrel shotgun sequencing   more formally known as pairwise   end sequencing  	0
 in pairwise   end sequencing   both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap  	1
 having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms  	0
 the process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation  	1
 annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology   such as designing pcr primers and rna targets  	0
 although mrna analysis is  step in the right direction   not all mrnas are translated into proteins  	0
 the study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics  	1
 proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes  	0
 such defects only account for approximately <num> percent of diseases in developed countries  	0
 most of the common diseases   such as heart disease   are multi   factored or polygenic   which is  phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes   and also involve environmental factors such as diet  	1
 in april <num>   scientists at stanford university published the genome analysis of  healthy individual   stephen quake    scientist at stanford university   who had his genome sequenced     the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases  	0
  heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation  	1
 scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when  change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the   fit   of the population to its environment  	0
 over time   evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species   but they have maintained the same overall layout  	1
 scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures  	0
  species is  group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile   viable offspring  	1
 according to this definition   one species is distinguished from another when   in nature   it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring  	0
 biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories  	0
 allopatric speciation   allo    	1
 sympatric speciation   sym    	1
 over time   the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from  single species  	1
 this is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from  single point of origin   thus   causing the species to radiate into several new ones  	0
 island archipelagos like the hawaiian islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms  	0
 given enough time   the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction   if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together   mating would be less likely   but if mating occurred   offspring would be non   viable or infertile  	0
 many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation   the ability to interbreed   of the two populations  	1
 many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year   often just annually  	0
 differences in breeding schedules   called temporal isolation   can act as  form of reproductive isolation  	1
 for example   two species of frogs inhabit the same area   but one reproduces from january to march   whereas the other reproduces from march to may <link>  	0
 these two related frog species exhibit temporal reproductive isolation  	0
 other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells   eggs and sperm   prevent fertilization from taking place   this is called  gametic barrier  	1
 similarly   in some cases closely related organisms try to mate   but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together  	0
 in sum   the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes   such as natural selection   can affect  population   genetic makeup   and   in turn   how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species  	1
 the theory also connects this change of  population over time   called microevolution   with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters   called macroevolution  	1
 some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way   meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele   while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from  dominant allele from the gene pool  	0
 the gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in  population  	1
 populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic  	1
 the distribution of phenotypes among individuals   known as the population variation   is influenced by  number of factors   including the population   genetic structure and the environment <link>  	1
 understanding the sources of  phenotypic variation in  population is important for determining how  population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures  	0
 when scientists are involved in the breeding of  species   such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves   they try to increase  population   genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can  	0
 this also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding   the mating of closely related individuals   which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease  	1
 for example    disease that is caused by  rare   recessive allele might exist in  population   but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele  	0
 another way  population   allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift <link>   which is simply the effect of chance  	0
 by chance   some individuals will have more offspring than others   not due to an advantage conferred by some genetically   encoded trait   but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time   when the receptive female walked by   or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time   when  fox was hunting    	1
 if individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers   the result can be  changing population  	0
 there are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs  	0
 one reason is simple mate choice   for example   female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger   brighter tails  	0
 such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant  	0
 one type of geographic variation   called  cline   can be seen as populations of  given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient  	1
 species of warm   blooded animals   for example   tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earth   poles   allowing them to better conserve heat  	0
 however   it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts   but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population  	1
 this concept   called relative fitness   allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation   and thus   how the population might evolve  	0
 sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection   while the intermediate phenotypes are   on average   less fit  	1
 known as diversifying selection <link>   this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms  	0
 large   dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force   while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha male   territory  	0
 the speculation is that large tails carry risk   and only the best males survive that risk   the bigger the tail   the more fit the male  	0
 this idea is known as the handicap principle  	0
 in scientific terms   the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny  	1
  phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism   such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved   to which species it is most closely related   and so forth  	0
 in  rooted tree   the branching indicates evolutionary relationships <link>  	0
 the point where  split occurs   called  branch point   represents where  single lineage evolved into  distinct new one  	1
  lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon  	1
 when two lineages stem from the same branch point   they are called sister taxa  	1
  branch with more than two lineages is called  polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships  	1
 it is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor   it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other  	0
 for example   after the common beginning of all life   scientists divide organisms into three large categories called  domain   bacteria   archaea   and eukarya  	1
 within each domain is  second category called  kingdom  	1
 after kingdoms   the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are   phylum   class   order   family   genus   and species <link>  	0
 therefore   the scientific name of the dog is canis lupus  	0
 the name at each level is also called  taxon  	1
 in other words   dogs are in order carnivora  	0
 how do scientists construct phylogenetic trees  	0
 after the homologous and analogous traits are sorted   scientists often organize the homologous traits using  system called cladistics  	0

 now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure  	0
 only some of the organisms in <link> have this trait   and to those that do   it is called  shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree  	1
 the tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative  	0
 the same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used  	0
 more recently    fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered  	0
 small   virus   like particles called gene transfer agents   gtas   transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another  	1
 gtas have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes   sometimes at  very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes  	0
 the nucleus   first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first   <link>      followed by  later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria  	1
 the mitochondria   first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in  prokaryotic host   <link>      which subsequently acquired  nucleus   by fusion or other mechanisms   to become the first eukaryotic cell  	1
 most interestingly   the eukaryote   first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity   <link>     	1
 others have proposed abandoning any tree   like model of phylogeny in favor of  ring structure   the so   called   ring of life   <link>    phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from  pool of primitive prokaryotes  	1
 lake   again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm   proposes  ring   like model in which species of all three domains   archaea   bacteria   and eukarya   evolved from  single pool of gene   swapping prokaryotes  	1
 they therefore lack most of the components of cells   such as organelles   ribosomes   and the plasma membrane  	0
  virion consists of  nucleic acid core   an outer protein coating or capsid   and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell  	1
 viruses may also contain additional proteins   such as enzymes  	0
 many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors <link>  	0
 for these viruses   attachment is  requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane   so they can complete their replication inside the cell  	0
 group  viruses contain double   stranded dna   dsdna   as their genome  	0
 their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna  	0
 the strands separate   and one of them is used as  template for the generation of mrna using the rna   dependent rna polymerase encoded by the virus  	0
 group iv viruses have ssrna as their genome with  positive polarity  	0
 positive polarity means that the genomic rna can serve directly as mrna  	0
 multiple   full   length rna strands of negative polarity   complimentary to the positive   stranded genomic rna   are formed from these intermediates   which may then serve as templates for the production of rna with positive polarity   including both full   length genomic rna and shorter viral mrnas  	0
 group  viruses contain ssrna genomes with  negative polarity   meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mrna  	0
 as with group iv viruses   dsrna intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mrna  	0
 viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host  	0
 cells that  virus may use to replicate are called permissive  	1
 for most viruses   the molecular basis for this specificity is that  particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach  	0
 the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus   which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body   and from cell damage caused by the virus  	0
 many animal viruses   such as hiv   human immunodeficiency virus     leave the infected cells of the immune system by  process known as budding   where virions leave the cell individually  	1
 during the budding process   the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed  	0
 bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria <link>  	1
 when infection of  cell by  bacteriophage results in the production of new virions   the infection is said to be productive  	1
 if the virions are released by bursting the cell   the virus replicates by means of  lytic cycle <link>  	1
 for example   when  temperate bacteriophage infects  bacterial cell   it replicates by means of  lysogenic cycle <link>   and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell  	1

 examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza  	0
 some animal   infecting viruses   including the hepatitis  virus discussed above   are known as oncogenic viruses   they have the ability to cause cancer  	1

 still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells    process known as cell necrosis  	1
 the danger of using live vaccines   which are usually more effective than killed vaccines   is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease   causing form by back mutations  	0
 live vaccines are usually made by attenuating   weakening   the   wild   type     disease   causing   virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host  	0
 another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect  	0

 therefore   only those organisms that can grow without oxygen   anaerobic organisms   were able to live  	1
 autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs   and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth  	1
 then   cyanobacteria   also known as blue   green algae   evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later  	0
 for example    soda lake is both salty and alkaline   so organisms that live in  soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles <link>  	1
 other extremophiles   like radioresistant organisms   do not prefer an extreme environment   in this case   one with high levels of radiation     but have adapted to survive in it <link>  	0

 behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to  stimulus  	1
 behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes  	1
 one goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors   which have  strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences   from the learned behaviors   which result from environmental conditioning  	1
 innate behavior   or instinct   is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned  	0

 formation of the ftsz ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site  	0
  septum is formed between the nucleoids   extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell  	0
 when the new cell walls are in place   the daughter cells separate  	0
 haploid cells   containing  single copy of each homologous chromosome   are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores  	0
 spores are haploid cells that can produce  haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form  diploid cell  	1
 all animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm   or gametes  	0
 the synaptonemal complex    lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes   first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes  	1
 the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis  	1
 in synapsis   the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other  	0
 located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules  	1
 these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover   or genetic recombination   between the non   sister chromatids  	0
 near the recombination nodule on each chromatid   the double   stranded dna is cleaved   the cut ends are modified   and  new connection is made between the non   sister chromatids  	0
 when the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another   the ploidy level   the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus   has been reduced from two to one  	1
 for this reason   meiosis  is referred to as  reduction division  	0
 there is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis  	0
 nearly all animals employ  diploid   dominant life   cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes  	1
 early in the development of the embryo   specialized diploid cells   called germ cells   are produced within the gonads   such as the testes and ovaries  	1
 germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes  	0
 supported by the monastery   he taught physics   botany   and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels  	0
 in <num>   he began  decade   long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants   ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system    system with convenient characteristics used to study  specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems    	1
 in <num>   mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly <num> <num> pea plants to the local natural history society  	0
 mendel was the first researcher to see it  	0
 instead of continuous characteristics   mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes   specifically   violet versus white flowers     this is referred to as discontinuous variation  	1
 mendel   choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring   nor were they absorbed   but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on  	0
 mendel collected the seeds belonging to the <chem> plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season  	1
 these offspring were called the <chem>   or the first filial   filial   offspring   daughter or son     generation  	0
 once mendel examined the characteristics in the <chem> generation of plants   he allowed them to self   fertilize naturally  	0
 when mendel transferred pollen from  plant with violet flowers to the stigma of  plant with white flowers and vice versa   he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent   male or female   contributed which trait  	0
 this is called  reciprocal cross    paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross  	1
 for the other six characteristics mendel examined   the <chem> and <chem> generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color  	0
 the product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics  	0
 the product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone  	1
 two alleles for  given gene in  diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics  	0
 the observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype  	1
 an organism   underlying genetic makeup   consisting of both physically visible and non   expressed alleles   is called its genotype  	1
 mendel   parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait  	0
 when <chem> plants with contrasting traits were cross   fertilized   all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait   meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined  	0
 beyond predicting the offspring of  cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents   mendel also developed  way to determine whether an organism that expressed  dominant trait was  heterozygote or  homozygote  	1
 called the test cross   this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders  	0
 in  test cross   the dominant   expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic  	0
  variation on incomplete dominance is codominance   in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote  	1
 an example of codominance is the mn blood groups of humans  	0
 the sex chromosomes are one pair of non   homologous chromosomes  	0
 until now   we have only considered inheritance patterns among non   sex chromosomes   or autosomes  	0
 in addition to <num> homologous pairs of autosomes   human females have  homologous pair of  chromosomes   whereas human males have an xy chromosome pair  	1
 because the gene is essential   these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization   die in utero   or die later in life   depending on what life stage requires this gene  	0
 an inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non   lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal for crosses between heterozygous individuals with  recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous   only wild   type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed  	1
 the genotypic ratio would therefore be <num> <num>  	0
 observing that true   breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to <chem> generations that all expressed the dominant trait and <chem> generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in  <num> <num> ratio   mendel proposed the law of segregation  	0
 this law states that paired unit factors   genes   must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor  	1
 however   each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes   organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on  string  	0
 the segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage   in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as  pair  	1
 however   because of the process of recombination   or   crossover     it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently   or as if they are not linked  	0
 it is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes   known as synapsis   does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells  	1
 when synapsed   homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in  process called homologous recombination   or more simply     crossing over  	1
 conversely   alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together  	0
 the average number of crossovers between two alleles   that is   their recombination frequency   correlated with their genetic distance from each other   relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome  	1
 considering the example cross between aabb and aabb above   the frequency of recombination could be calculated as <num> <num>   <num>  	0
  karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes   and includes their length   banding pattern   and centromere position  	1
 to obtain  view of an individual   karyotype   cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into  chart   or karyogram   also known as an ideogram <link>  	1
 disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes   as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes  	0
 they are caused by nondisjunction   which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis  	1
 misaligned or incomplete synapsis   or  dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration   can cause nondisjunction  	0
 an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets   two for diploid species   is called polyploid  	1
 for instance   fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with  normal haploid sperm would yield  triploid zygote  	0
 an inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere   or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere <link>  	0
  pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms   making these inversions easily identifiable  	0
 gel electrophoresis is  technique used to separate dna fragments of different sizes  	1
 usually the gel is made of  chemical called agarose  	1
 two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi  directionally as replication proceeds  	0
 single   strand binding proteins coat the single strands of dna near the replication fork to prevent the single   stranded dna from winding back into  double helix  	0
 dna polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the <num>   to <num>   direction    new dna strand can be only extended in this direction    	0
 one strand   which is complementary to the <num>   to <num>   parental dna strand   is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction  	1
 this continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand  	0
 the other strand   complementary to the <num>   to <num>   parental dna   is extended away from the replication fork   in small fragments known as okazaki fragments   each requiring  primer to start the synthesis  	0

  protein called the sliding clamp holds the dna polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides  	0
 the sliding clamp is  ring   shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place  	1
 most of the mistakes during dna replication are promptly corrected by dna polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added <link>  	0
 in proofreading   the dna pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one   so  correction can be made  	0
 the polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand  	0
 errors during dna replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in dna  	0
 mutations   variations in the nucleotide sequence of  genome   can also occur because of damage to dna  	1
 such mutations may be of two types   induced or spontaneous  	0
 mutations may have  wide range of effects  	0
 some mutations are not expressed   these are known as silent mutations  	1
 point mutations are those mutations that affect  single base pair  	1
 transition substitution refers to  purine or pyrimidine being replaced by  base of the same kind   for example    purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine  	1
 transversion substitution refers to  purine being replaced by  pyrimidine   or vice versa   for example   cytosine    pyrimidine   is replaced by adenine    purine  	1
 mutations can also be the result of the addition of  base   known as an insertion   or the removal of  base   also known as deletion  	1
 the flow of genetic information in cells from dna to mrna to protein is described by the central dogma <link>   which states that genes specify the sequence of mrnas   which in turn specify the sequence of proteins  	1
 the decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and rnas  	0
 this demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid  	1
 these nucleotide triplets are called codons  	0
 the insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame   thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid <link>  	0
 the central region of the cell in which prokaryotic dna resides is called the nucleoid  	1
 in addition   prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids   which are shorter circular dna molecules that may only contain one or  few genes  	1
 plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance transcription in prokaryotes   and in eukaryotes   requires the dna double helix to partially unwind in the region of mrna synthesis  	0
 the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first <num>   mrna nucleotide is transcribed is called the  <num> site   or the initiation site  	1
 nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream  	0
 coli   the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits   two of which are identical  	0
 four of these subunits   denoted             and     comprise the polymerase core enzyme  	0

 although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes    few elements are conserved  	0
 at the  <num> and  <num> regions upstream of the initiation site   there are two promoter consensus sequences   or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species <link>  	1
 the  <num> consensus sequence   called the  <num> region   is tataat  	1
 the mrna folds back on itself   and the complementary     nucleotides bind together  	0
 the result is  stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe  region rich in     nucleotides  	0
 the complementary     region of the mrna transcript forms only  weak interaction with the template dna  	0
 this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors  	0
 further upstream of the tata box   eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more gc   rich boxes   ggcg   or octamer boxes   atttgcat    	0
 these elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more   active   genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell  	0
 each mrna molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes   all synthesizing protein in the same direction   reading the mrna from <num>   to <num>   and synthesizing the polypeptide from the  terminus to the  terminus  	0
 the complete mrna   poly   ribosome structure is called  polysome  	1
 when an in   frame aug is encountered during translation elongation    non   formylated methionine is inserted by  regular met   trnamet in ecoli mrna    sequence upstream of the first aug codon   called the shine   dalgarno sequence   aggagg     interacts with the rrna molecules that compose the ribosome  	1
 this interaction anchors the <num> ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mrna template  	0
 during and after translation   individual amino acids may be chemically modified   signal sequences may be appended   and the new protein   folds   into  distinct three   dimensional structure as  result of intramolecular interactions  	0
  signal sequence is  short tail of amino acids that directs  protein to  specific cellular compartment  	1
 these sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein     train ticket   to its ultimate destination  	0
 once elongation is complete   the pre   mrna is cleaved by an endonuclease between an aauaaa consensus sequence and  gu   rich sequence   leaving the aauaaa sequence on the pre   mrna  	0
 an enzyme called poly    polymerase then adds  string of approximately <num>  residues   called the poly    tail  	1
 this modification further protects the pre   mrna from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm  	0
 some of  ribosome   rna molecules are purely structural   whereas others have catalytic or binding activities  	0
 mature trnas take on  three   dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end <link>  	0
 the anticodon is  three   nucleotide sequence in  trna that interacts with an mrna codon through complementary base pairing  	1
 the dna of prokaryotes is organized into  circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm  	0
 proteins that are needed for  specific function   or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway   are encoded together in blocks called operons  	1
 for example   all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose   or lac   operon  	0
 coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes  	0
 these five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan   trp   operon <link>  	0
 if tryptophan is present in the environment   then   	0
 when tryptophan is not present in the cell   the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator   therefore   the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized  	0
 because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off   the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators  	0
 the lac operon   an inducer operonthe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons   which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell  	1
 the lac operon is  typical inducible operon  	0
 there are hundreds of transcription factors in  cell that each bind specifically to  particular dna sequence motif  	0
 when transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene   it is referred to as  cis   acting element   because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene  	1

 they are not introns   those have been removed in the nucleus    	0
 the mirnas are made in the nucleus as longer pre   mirnas  	0
 these pre   mirnas are chopped into mature mirnas by  protein called dicer  	0
 like transcription factors and rbps   mature mirnas recognize  specific sequence and bind to the rna   however   mirnas also associate with  ribonucleoprotein complex called the rna   induced silencing complex   risc    	0
 in translation   the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex  	1
 the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor <num>   eif <num>    	1
 the eif <num> protein is active when it binds to the high   energy molecule guanosine triphosphate   gtp    	0

 the current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false   negative results  	0
  false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive  	1
 in other words   many cases of cancer go undetected   which makes biomarkers unreliable  	0
 traditionally   microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions   which involves isolating  single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory  	1
 because microorganisms can go through several generations in  matter of hours   their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly  	0
 natural selection can only take place if there is variation   or differences   among individuals in  population  	0
 importantly   these differences must have some genetic basis   otherwise   the selection will not lead to change in the next generation  	0
 however   the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures  	0
 this phenomenon is called convergent evolution   where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share  common ancestry  	1
 the two species came to the same function   flying   but did so separately from each other these physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs  	0
 individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with  	0
 an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce   forming hybrids   is called  hybrid zone  	1

 in the gradual speciation model   species diverge gradually over time in small steps  	1
 in the punctuated equilibrium model    new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species   and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward <link>  	1
 this early change model is called punctuated equilibrium   because it begins with  punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward  	0
 given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation   the formation of two species from one original species  	1
 darwin envisioned this process as  branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in on the origin of species   <link>     	0
 biologists group allopatric processes into two categories   dispersal and vicariance  	0
 dispersal is when  few members of  species move to  new geographical area   and vicariance is when  natural situation arises to physically divide organisms  	1
 the other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form  viable offspring called an allopolyploid  	1
 the prefix   allo    means   other     recall from allopatric     therefore   an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine  	0
 therefore    prezygotic barrier is  mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place   this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction  	1
  postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation   this includes organisms that do   survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile  	1
 behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of  specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place  	1
 for example   male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females  	0
 initially   the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur  	0
 but over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis   the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the <num> and is generally accepted today  	1
 in sum   the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes   such as natural selection   can affect  population   genetic makeup   and   in turn   how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species  	0
 the allele frequency   or gene frequency   is the rate at which  specific allele appears within  population  	1
 until now we have discussed evolution as  change in the characteristics of  population of organisms   but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change  	0
 if these are the only two possible alleles for  given locus in the population         <num>  	0
 in other words   all the  alleles and all the  alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population but what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles   but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes   known as the population   genetic structure   from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes  	0
 if the phenotype is observed   only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known   the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes  	0
 the diversity of alleles and genotypes within  population is called genetic variance  	1
 when scientists are involved in the breeding of  species   such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves   they try to increase  population   genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can  	0
 over time   the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population   and the population will   as  result   grow larger on average  	0
 that is   this would occur if this particular selection pressure   or driving selective force   were the only one acting on the population  	0
 in other examples   better camouflage or  stronger resistance to drought might pose  selection pressure  	0
 another important evolutionary force is gene flow   the flow of alleles in and out of  population due to the migration of individuals or gametes <link>  	1
 while some populations are fairly stable   others experience more flux  	0
 geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations  	0
 such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant  	0
 one type of geographic variation   called  cline   can be seen as populations of  given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient  	1
 an individual may carry  very beneficial genotype with  resulting phenotype that   for example   increases the ability to reproduce   fecundity     but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in  fatal childhood disease   that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age  	1
 natural selection acts at the level of the individual   it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation   known as an organism   evolutionary   darwinian   fitness  	1
 when the environment changes   populations will often undergo directional selection <link>   which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation  	1
  classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth   and nineteenth   century england  	0
 males are often larger   for example   and display many elaborate colors and adornments   like the peacock   tail   while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration  	1
 such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms <link>   which arise from the fact that in many populations   particularly animal populations   there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females  	0
 that is   some males   often the bigger   stronger   or more decorated males   get the vast majority of the total matings   while others receive none  	0
 in <num>   biologist ronald fisher proposed another model of sexual selection   the fisherian runaway model   which suggests that selection of certain traits is  result of sexual preference in both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis   the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males   quality   thus giving females  way to find the fittest mates   males that will pass the best genes to their offspring  	1
 many phylogenetic trees have  single lineage at the base representing  common ancestor  	0
 scientists call such trees rooted   which means there is  single ancestral lineage   typically drawn from the bottom or left   to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate  	0
 notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains   bacteria   archaea   and eukarya   diverge from  single point and branch off  	0
  lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon  	1
 when two lineages stem from the same branch point   they are called sister taxa  	1
  branch with more than two lineages is called  polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships  	1
 taxonomy   which literally means   arrangement law     is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings  	1

 the nucleus   first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first     link      followed by  later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria  	1
 the mitochondria   first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in  prokaryotic host   <link>      which subsequently acquired  nucleus   by fusion or other mechanisms   to become the first eukaryotic cell  	1
 as shown in   link    some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes   whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts  	1
 this model is often called the   web of life  	0
   in an effort to save the tree analogy   some have proposed using the ficus tree   <link>    with its multiple trunks as  phylogenetic to represent  diminished evolutionary role for hgt  	0
 in the      phylogenetic model proposed by wford doolittle   the   tree of life   arose from  community of ancestral cells   has multiple trunks   and has connections between branches where horizontal gene transfer has occurred  	1
 visually   this concept is better represented by      the multi   trunked ficus than by the single trunk of the oak similar to the tree drawn by darwin <link>  	0
 all virions have  nucleic acid genome covered by  protective layer of proteins   called  capsid  	1

 viral genomes tend to be small   containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus can not get from the host cell  	0
 they convert their single   stranded genomes into  dsdna intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur  	0
 group iii viruses use dsrna as their genome  	0
 the strands separate   and one of them is used as  template for the generation of mrna using the rna   dependent rna polymerase encoded by the virus  	0
 then   mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was integrated into the host genome  	0
 group vii viruses have partial dsdna genomes and make ssrna intermediates that act as mrna   but are also converted back into dsdna genomes by reverse transcriptase   necessary for genome replication  	0

 the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus   which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body   and from cell damage caused by the virus  	0
 bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria <link>  	1
 when infection of  cell by  bacteriophage results in the production of new virions   the infection is said to be productive  	0
 sometimes   however    virus can remain within the cell without being released  	0
 for example   when  temperate bacteriophage infects  bacterial cell   it replicates by means of  lysogenic cycle <link>   and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell  	0
 when the phage dna is incorporated into the host cell genome   it is called  prophage  	1
 the viral genome is then   injected   into the host cell through these channels in  manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages  	0
 enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors   receptor   mediated endocytosis   or fusion  	0
 many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor   mediated endocytosis in  fashion similar to some non   enveloped viruses  	0
 other viruses cause long   term chronic infections   such as the virus causing hepatitis    whereas others   like herpes simplex virus   only cause intermittent symptoms  	0
 still other viruses   such as human herpesviruses <num> and <num>   which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola   often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host   and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection  	1
 when plants viruses are transferred between different plants   this is known as horizontal transmission   and when they are inherited from  parent   this is called vertical transmission symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host <link>  	1
 one common symptom is hyperplasia   the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls  	1
 other viruses induce hypoplasia   or decreased cell growth   in the leaves of plants   causing thin   yellow areas to appear  	0
 while we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs   such as those used to treat hiv and influenza   the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination   which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to  virus or virus family <link>  	1

 with the evolution of photosynthesis about <num> billion years ago   some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use  more widely available energy source   sunlight   whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food  	0
 evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of earth   existence   the atmosphere was anoxic   meaning that there was no molecular oxygen  	1
 therefore   only those organisms that can grow without oxygen   anaerobic organisms   were able to live  	1
 autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs   and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth  	1
 other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles   meaning   lovers of extremes  	1

 these molecules are important because they regulate how   cell will interact with and respond to an apc  	0
 na ve <chem>   cells bind apcs via their antigen   embedded mhc ii molecules and are stimulated to become helper    th   lymphocytes   cells that go on to stimulate  cells   or cytotoxic  cells   directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat  	1
 in contrast   <chem>   cells engage antigen   embedded mhc  molecules on apcs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic  lymphocytes   ctls     which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response  	1
 when  <chem> cell detects that   cell is bound to  relevant antigen   it secretes specific cytokines that induce the  cell to proliferate rapidly   which makes thousands of identical   clonal   copies of it   and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the bcrs  	0
 the activation of  cells corresponding to one specific bcr variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection  	1
 this phenomenon drastically   but briefly   changes the proportions of bcr variants expressed by the immune system   and shifts the balance toward bcrs specific to the infecting pathogen  	0

 neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system   <num> billion strong at birth  	1
 like all cells   neurons consist of several different parts   each serving  specialized function <link>  	0
 the nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma   or cell body  	1
 the soma has branching extensions known as dendrites  	0
 the neuron is  small information processor   and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons  	1
 axons range in length from  fraction of an inch to several feet  	0
 in some axons   glial cells form  fatty substance known as the myelin sheath   which coats the axon and acts as an insulator   increasing the speed at which the signal travels  	1
 the myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system   the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function  	0
 we begin at the neuronal membrane  	0
 the neuron exists in  fluid environment   it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid      cytoplasm    	1
 the neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate    critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra  and extracellular fluids being electrically different  	0
 the action potential is an all   or   none phenomenon  	0
 in simple terms   this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation  	1
 there are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons   and we can speak in broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters <link>  	0
 much of what psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in psychological disorders  	0
 psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for  given neurotransmitter system  	1
 agonists are chemicals that mimic  neurotransmitter at the receptor site and   thus   strengthen its effects  	1
 an antagonist   on the other hand   blocks or impedes the normal activity of  neurotransmitter at the receptor  	1
 the somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary  	1
 it is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the cns   therefore   it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons  	0
 the two systems have complementary functions   operating in tandem to maintain the body   homeostasis  	0
 homeostasis is  state of equilibrium   in which biological conditions   such as body temperature   are maintained at optimal levels  	1

 the auditory cortex   the main area responsible for processing auditory information   is located within the temporal lobe  	1
 the occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain   and contains the primary visual cortex   which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information  	1
 the occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain   and contains the primary visual cortex   which is responsible for interpreting incoming visual information  	1
 the occipital cortex is organized retinotopically   which means there is  close relationship between the position of an object in  person   visual field and the position of that object   representation on the cortex  	1
 the occipital cortex is organized retinotopically   which means there is  close relationship between the position of an object in  person   visual field and the position of that object   representation on the cortex  	1
 the limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory  	1
 interestingly   the sense of smell projects directly to the limbic system   therefore   not surprisingly   smell can evoke emotional responses in ways that other sensory modalities can not  	0
 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories  	1
 the hypothalamus regulates  number of homeostatic processes   including the regulation of body temperature   appetite   and blood pressure  	1
 the hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the regulation of sexual motivation and behavior  	0
 midbrain and hindbrain structures	0
 the midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain   between the forebrain and the hindbrain  	1
 the reticular formation is centered in the midbrain   but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain  	1
 the reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep   wake cycle   arousal   alertness   and motor activity  	0
 it contains the medulla   pons   and cerebellum <link>  	0
 the medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system   such as breathing   blood pressure   and heart rate  	1
 the word pons literally means   bridge     and as the name suggests   the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord  	1

 located in the neck   the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth   metabolism   and appetite  	1
 in hyperthyroidism   or grave   disease   the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine   causing agitation   bulging eyes   and weight loss  	1
 these pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels   insulin   or raising them   glucagon    	0
 people who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin   therefore   they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production   and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume the gonads secrete sexual hormones   which are important in reproduction   and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior  	1
 the female gonads are the ovaries   the male gonads are the testes  	1
 visit this website to see an example of  consent form while the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing   sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants   knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study  	0
 deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment   but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful  	1
 for example   if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire   we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants   responses  	0
 many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects  	0
 often   these researchers use rodents <link> or birds as the subjects of their experiments   the apa estimates that <num>   of all animal research in psychology uses these species   american psychological association   nd   	0
 because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans   these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants  	1
 we can measure correlation by calculating  statistic known as  correlation coefficient  	0
  correlation coefficient is  number from  <num> to  <num> that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables  	1
 the correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter   	0
 correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables  	1
 however   correlation is limited because establishing the existence of  relationship tells us little about cause and effect  	1
 while variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other   it could also be that some other factor    confounding variable   is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest  	0
 we also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations   especially with unsystematic observations  	0
 illusory correlations   or false correlations   occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists  	1
 one well   known illusory correlation is the supposed effect that the moon   phases have on human behavior  	0
 in order to conduct an experiment    researcher must have  specific hypothesis to be tested  	0
 as you  ve learned   hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research  	1
 ideally   the people who observe and record the children   behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group   in order to control for experimenter bias  	0
 experimenter bias refers to the possibility that  researcher   expectations might skew the results of the study  	1
 remember   conducting an experiment requires  lot of planning   and the people involved in the research project have  vested interest in supporting their hypotheses  	0
 because by doing so   we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations  	0
 if you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect   you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration  	0
 the placebo effect occurs when people   expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in  given situation  	1
 our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include  	0
 participants are the subjects of psychological research   and as the name implies   individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process  	1
 often   psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants  	0
 random assignment is critical for sound experimental design  	0
 with sufficiently large samples   random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups  	1
 poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out   and even well   designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested  	0
 peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it   meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability  	1
 sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding  	0
 in observational research   scientists are conducting  clinical or case study when they focus on one person or just  few individuals  	1
 indeed   some scientists spend their entire careers studying just <num>   <num> individuals  	0
 the information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another  	0
 the anthropologist jane goodall   for example   spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in africa <link>  	0
 as an illustration of the types of concerns that  researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation   some scientists criticized goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers   using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study   mckie   <num>    	0
 to protect against this type of bias   researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified  	0
 in addition   researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers   in order to test inter   rater reliability    measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers  	1
 instead   they use existing records to answer various research questions  	0
 this type of research approach is known as archival research  	0
 archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships  	1
 even without significant life changes   some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project  	0
 as  result   the attrition rates   or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts   in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of  project  	1
 for this reason   researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that  substantial number will drop out before the end  	0
 in the end   research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions  	0
 facts are observable realities   and opinions are personal judgments   conclusions   or attitudes that may or may not be accurate  	1
 in the scientific community   facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research the process of scientific research	0
 scientific knowledge is advanced through  process known as the scientific method  	0
 we  ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas   but what sort of ideas are they   exactly  	0
  theory is  well   developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena  	1
 theories are repeatedly checked against the world   but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once   instead   researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of  theory  	0
  scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable   or capable of being shown to be incorrect  	1
 recall from the introductory chapter that sigmund freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors <link>  	0
 however    major criticism of freud   theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable   for example   it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the     the ego   and the superego   the three elements of personality described in freud   theories  	0
 the scientific method is also  form of empiricism  	0
 an empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation   including experimentation   rather than  method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities  	1
 in some areas in psychology   it is common for individuals who have recently earned their phd to seek out positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty  	0
 in most cases   young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for  full   time faculty position  	0
 as the name suggests   biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior  	1
 while biological psychology is  broad field   many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior <link>  	0
 as mentioned in the previous section   the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior  	1
 thus   cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions   or thoughts   and their relationship to our experiences and our actions  	1
 like biological psychology   cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from  diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds  	0
 personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique  	1
 several individuals      freud and maslow   that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology   and the american psychologist gordon allport   contributed to early theories of personality  	0
 social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others  	1
 social psychologists conduct research on  wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others   prejudice   and attraction   and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts  	1
 health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological   psychological   and sociocultural factors  	1
 this particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model <link>  	0
 clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior  	1
 as such   it is generally considered to be  more applied area within psychology   however   some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research  	0
 forensic psychology is  branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context of the justice system  	1
 for example   forensic psychologists   and forensic psychiatrists   will assess  person   competency to stand trial   assess the state of mind of  defendant   act as consultants on child custody cases   consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations   and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children   testimony   american board of forensic psychology   <num>    	0
 these experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate   interpretation   in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately   since it can not be seen by any other person  	0
 this attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism  	1

 by analyzing dreams   freud thought people could increase self   awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives  	0
 the <num>th century swiss psychiatrist carl jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious  	0
 the collective unconscious   as described by jung   is  theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone  	1
 according to jung   certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location  	0

 it is often prescribed for minor pain   and it is available over   the   counter in some other countries  	0
 meditation is the act of focusing on  single target   such as the breath or  repeated sound   to increase awareness of the moment  	1
 while hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of  therapist and the person being treated   an individual can perform meditation alone  	1
 the sensitivity of  given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold  	0
 absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected <num>   of the time  	1
 another way to think about this is by asking how dim can  light be or how soft can  sound be and still be detected half of the time  	0
 while our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment   it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world  	0
 perception refers to the way sensory information is organized   interpreted   and consciously experienced  	1
 perception involves both bottom   up and top   down processing  	0
 in fact   we often do   perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time  	1
 this is known as sensory adaptation  	0
 imagine entering  classroom with an old analog clock  	0
 the shared experiences of people within  given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception  	0

 the amplitude of  wave is the height of  wave as measured from the highest point on the wave   peak or crest   to the lowest point on the wave   trough    	1
 wavelength refers to the length of  wave from one peak to the next  	1
 like light waves   the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound  	0
 the frequency of  sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound   pitch  	1
 high   frequency sound waves are perceived as high   pitched sounds   while low   frequency sound waves are perceived as low   pitched sounds  	1
 the eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision <link>  	1
 light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil  	1
 when light levels are high   the pupil will constrict   or become smaller   to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye  	1
 the pupil   size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the iris   which is the colored portion of the eye  	0
 the fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells <link>  	1
 these photoreceptor cells   known as cones   are light   detecting cells  	1
 the cones are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions  	0
 rods and cones are connected   via several interneurons   to retinal ganglion cells  	0
 axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve  	1
 the optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain  	1
 normal   sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision  	0
 each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to  slightly different wavelength of light  	0
 another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages  	0
 an afterimage describes the continuation of  visual sensation after removal of the stimulus  	1
 some of these are binocular cues   which means that they rely on the use of both eyes  	1
 one example of  binocular depth cue is binocular disparity   the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives  	1
 to experience this slightly different view   do this simple exercise   extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger  	0
 the place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies  	1
 more specifically   the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies  	0
 if  sound comes from an off   center location   it creates two types of binaural cues   interaural level differences and interaural timing differences  	0
 interaural level difference refers to the fact that  sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head  	1
 interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which  given sound wave arrives at each ear <link>  	1
 deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear  	1

 sometimes   classical conditioning can lead to habituation  	0
 habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to  stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change  	1
 as the stimulus occurs over and over   we learn not to focus our attention on it  	0
 psychologist bfskinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited   and it does   account for new behaviors such as riding  bike  	1
 he proposed  theory about how such behaviors come about  	0

 compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as  means to minimize the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of  feared event   apa   <num>    	1
 compulsions often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing   cleaning   checking      that  door is locked     and ordering      lining up all the pencils in  particular way     and they also include such mental acts as counting   praying   or reciting something to oneself <link>  	0
 compulsions characteristic of ocd are not performed out of pleasure   nor are they connected in  realistic way to the source of the distress or feared event  	0

 during the egg   journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes   to the uterus    sperm may fertilize an egg the egg and the sperm each contain <num> chromosomes  	0
 chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid   dna    	1
 dna is  helix   shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs  	1
 therefore   each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring   the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring   called the phenotype   are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents   called the genotype    	1
  person   genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual  	1
 phenotype   on the other hand   refers to the individual   inherited physical characteristics   which are  combination of genetic and environmental influences <link>  	1
      genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material   dna   inherited from one   parents  	1
 so far   we have discussed traits that involve just one gene   but few human characteristics are controlled by  single gene  	0
 most traits are polygenic   controlled by more than one gene  	1
 height is one example of  polygenic trait   as are skin color and weight  	0
 in this punnett square    represents the normal allele   and  represents the recessive allele that is associated with pku  	0
 each of us represents  unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment   range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction  	0
 range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate   and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall  	1
 for example   if an individual   genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in  rich   stimulating environment   then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation  	0
 as mentioned earlier   gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious  	0
 for instance   identical twins share the same genetic information   identical twins develop from  single fertilized egg that split   so the genetic material is exactly the same in each   in contrast   fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm   so the genetic material varies as with non   twin siblings    	1
 but even with identical genes   there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin   life  	0

 glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built   help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication   provide insulation to neurons   transport nutrients and waste products   and mediate immune responses  	1
 neurons   on the other hand   serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system  	1
 this section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons  	0
 the nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma   or cell body  	1
 the soma has branching extensions known as dendrites  	0
 these signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down  major extension from the soma known as the axon   which ends at multiple terminal buttons  	0
 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters   the chemical messengers of the nervous system  	1
 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters   the chemical messengers of the nervous system  	1
 once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse   they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron  	0
 receptors   proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach   vary in shape   with different shapes   matching   different neurotransmitters  	1
 between signals   the neuron membrane   potential is held in  state of readiness   called the resting potential  	1
 like  rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action   ions line up on either side of the cell membrane   ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates       sodium   potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane    	0
 this positive spike constitutes the action potential   the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals  	1
 the electrical signal moves down the axon like  wave   at each point   some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon   raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering  new influx of sodium ions  	0
 the neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron   and the process repeats itself in the new neuron   assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential    	0
 once the signal is delivered   excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away   are broken down into inactive fragments   or are reabsorbed in  process known as reuptake  	0
 reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it   in order to clear the synapse <link>  	1
 in this perspective   psychotropic medications can help improve the symptoms associated with these disorders  	0
 psychotropic medications are drugs that treat psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance  	1
 acetylcholine is involved in muscle action and memory   it can increase arousal and enhance cognition  	0
 the nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions   the central nervous system   cns   and the peripheral nervous system   pns     shown in <link>  	0
 the cns is comprised of the brain and spinal cord   the pns connects the cns to the rest of the body  	1
 it can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions <link>  	0
 the sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress   related activities   the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine   day   to   day operations  	1
 the two systems have complementary functions   operating in tandem to maintain the body   homeostasis  	0
 for example   think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give  presentation in front of  roomful of people   or right before taking  big test  	0
 you are in no real physical danger in those situations   and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the fight or flight response  	0
 this kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world   in fact   we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee  	0
 these gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers  	0
 the most prominent sulcus   known as the longitudinal fissure   is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or hemispheres   the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere  	1
 forebrain structuresthe two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain <link>   which is the largest part of the brain  	0
 the forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and  number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex   called subcortical structures     thalamus   hypothalamus   pituitary gland   and the limbic system   collection of structures    	1

 the brain   parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe   and is involved in processing information from the body   senses  	1
 it contains the somatosensory cortex   which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body   such as touch   temperature   and pain  	1
 the somatosensory cortex is organized topographically   which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex <link>  	0
 the auditory cortex   the main area responsible for processing auditory information   is located within the temporal lobe  	1
 wernicke   area   important for speech comprehension   is also located here  	1
 whereas individuals with damage to broca   area have difficulty producing language   those with damage to wernicke   area can produce sensible language   but they are unable to understand it <link>  	0
 other areas of the forebrainother areas of the forebrain   located beneath the cerebral cortex   include the thalamus and the limbic system  	0
 the thalamus is  sensory relay for the brain  	1
 all of our senses   with the exception of smell   are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing <link>  	0
 the hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory  	1
 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories  	1
 the hypothalamus regulates  number of homeostatic processes   including the regulation of body temperature   appetite   and blood pressure  	1
 midbrain and hindbrain structuresthe midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain   between the forebrain and the hindbrain  	1
 the reticular formation is centered in the midbrain   but it actually extends up into the forebrain and down into the hindbrain  	1
 the hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord  	1
 it contains the medulla   pons   and cerebellum <link>  	0
 the cerebellum   latin for   little brain     receives messages from muscles   tendons   joints   and structures in our ear to control balance   coordination   movement   and motor skills  	1
 the cerebellum is also thought to be an important area for processing some types of memories  	0
  computerized tomography   ct   scan involves taking  number of    rays of  particular section of  person   body or brain <link>  	1
 the    rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates   allowing  computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned  	0
 tissues of different densities give off different signals   which  computer interprets and displays on  monitor  	0
 functional magnetic resonance imaging   fmri   operates on the same principles   but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels  	1

 major glandsthe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain   and acts in close association with it  	1
 the pituitary is often referred to as the   master gland   because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system   although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus  	0
 the adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response   such as epinephrine   adrenaline   and norepinephrine   noradrenaline    	1
 the pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels   insulin and glucagon  	1
 these pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels   insulin   or raising them   glucagon    	0
 for one   each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment  	0
 an informed consent form provides  written description of what participants can expect during the experiment   including potential risks and implications of the research  	1
 it also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time  	0
  participant in the tuskegee syphilis study receives an injection  	0
 correlation means that there is  relationship between two or more variables   such as ice cream consumption and crime     but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect  	1
 when two variables are correlated   it simply means that as one variable changes   so does the other  	1
 put another way   it means that as one variable increases so does the other   and conversely   when one variable decreases so does the other  	0
  negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions  	1
 if two variables are negatively correlated    decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa  	0
 think back to our discussion of the research done by the american cancer society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer  	0
 it seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer   but if we were limited to correlational research   we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption  	0
 as you  ve learned   the only way to establish that there is  cause   and   effect relationship between two variables is to conduct  scientific experiment  	0
 experiment has  different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life  	0
 we also need to precisely define   or operationalize   what is considered violent and nonviolent  	0
 an operational definition is  description of how we will measure our variables   and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what  researcher measures in  particular experiment  	1
 in operationalizing violent behavior   we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior   or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges  	0
 in  double   blind study   both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments  	1
 why would  researcher want to run  study where no one knows who is in which group  	0
 in our example of how violent television programs affect children   display of violent behavior   the independent variable is the type of program   violent or nonviolent   viewed by participants in the study <link>  	0
  dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had  	1
 in our example   the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants  	0
 now that we have  sample   the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment  	0
 with random assignment   all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group  	1
 there is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group  	0
 the american psychological association   apa   publishes  manual detailing how to write  paper for submission to scientific journals  	0
 unlike an article that might be published in  magazine like psychology today   which targets  general audience with an interest in psychology   scientific journals generally publish peer   reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved in research themselves  	1
 this is where validity comes into play  	0
 validity refers to the extent to which  given instrument or tool accurately measures what it   supposed to measure  	1
 while any valid measure is by necessity reliable   the reverse is not necessarily true  	0

 as james saw it   psychology   purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world   and as such   his perspective was known as functionalism  	0
 functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment  	1
 these men are credited with introducing psychologists in the united states to various gestalt principles  	0
 the word gestalt roughly translates to   whole      major emphasis of gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although  sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts   how those parts relate to each other as  whole is often what the individual responds to in perception  	1
 for example    song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments   but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody   rhythm   and harmony  	0
 because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible   watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control  	1
 watson was  major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior   and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism  	0
  major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism  	0
 thus   humanism emerged  	0
 humanism is  perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans  	1
 two of the most well   known proponents of humanistic psychology are abraham maslow and carl rogers    hara        	0
 culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology   yet the effects of culture on psychology are under   studied  	0
 there is  risk that psychological theories and data derived from white   american settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true   betancourt   l pez   <num>    	0
 sleep is  state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness  	1
 wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness   thought   and behavior  	1
 in between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming   intoxication as  result of alcohol or other drug use   meditative states   hypnotic states   and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation  	0
 if we have biological rhythms   then is there some sort of biological clock  	0
 in the brain   the hypothalamus   which lies above the pituitary gland   is  main center of homeostasis  	1
 for example   most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day  	0
 one important regulator of sleep   wake cycles is the hormone melatonin  	0
 the pineal gland   an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin   is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep   hardeland   pandi   perumal     cardinali   <num>    	1
 when we do this   we often experience jet lag  	0
 jet lag is  collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment  	1
 these symptoms include fatigue   sluggishness   irritability   and insomnia       consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights  week over  month   time     roth   <num>    	1
 when people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day   to   day life   they accumulate  sleep debt  	0
  person with  sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on  chronic basis  	0
 the consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency  	0
 one popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology  	0
 evolutionary psychology is  discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as  result of natural selection  	1
 variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring  	0
 the first stage of nrem sleep is known as stage <num> sleep  	0
 stage <num> sleep is  transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep   the period during which we drift off to sleep  	1
 during this time   there is  slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat  	0
 as we move into stage <num> sleep   the body goes into  state of deep relaxation  	1
 theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain   but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles <link>  	0
 theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain   but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles <link>  	0
 stage <num> and stage <num> of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow   wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency   up to <num> hz     high amplitude delta waves <link>  	1
 during this time   an individual   heart rate and respiration slow dramatically  	0
 manifest content is the actual content   or storyline   of  dream  	1
 latent content   on the other hand   refers to the hidden meaning of  dream  	1
 for instance   if  woman dreams about being chased by  snake   freud might have argued that this represents the woman   fear of sexual intimacy   with the snake serving as  symbol of  man   penis  	0
 some forms of psychotherapy   such as cognitive   behavioral therapy   can help sufferers of insomnia  	0
 cognitive   behavioral therapy is  type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors  	1
 the treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia      spending more waking time in bed    	0
 rem sleep behavior disorder   rbd   occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the rem sleep phase does not occur  	1
 individuals who suffer from rbd have high levels of physical activity during rem sleep   especially during disturbing dreams  	0
 sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which  sleeper   breathing stops  	1
 these episodes can last <num>   <num> seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal  	0
 in central sleep apnea   disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing   white   <num>   	1
 one of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of  special device during sleep  	0
  continuous positive airway pressure   cpap   device includes  mask that fits over the sleeper   nose and mouth   which is connected to  pump that pumps air into the person   airways   forcing them to remain open   as shown in <link>  	1
 some newer cpap masks are smaller and cover only the nose  	0
 unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section    person with narcolepsy can not resist falling asleep at inopportune times  	1
 these sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy   which is  lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness   and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles  	1
 this is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during rem sleep   burgess   scammell   <num>   hishikawa   shimizu   <num>   luppi et al   <num>    	0
 in individuals diagnosed with  substance use disorder   there is  compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence  	0
 in individuals diagnosed with  substance use disorder   there is  compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence  	1
 physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions   the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use  	1
 physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions   the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use  	1
 in contrast    person who has psychological dependence has an emotional   rather than physical   need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress  	1
 tolerance is linked to physiological dependence   and it occurs when  person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses  	1
 ethanol   which we commonly refer to as alcohol   is in  class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants <link>  	0
  depressant is  drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity  	1
 other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines  	0
 the cocaine   amphetamine   cathinones   and mdma users seek  euphoric high   feelings of intense elation and pleasure   especially in those users who take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking  	0
 repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences  	0
 an opioid is one of  category of drugs that includes heroin   morphine   methadone   and codeine  	1
 opioids have analgesic properties   that is   they decrease pain  	0
 methadone is  synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs  	1
 methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone  	1
 other drugs   including the opioid buprenorphine   have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal  	0
 hypnosis is  state of extreme self   focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli  	1
 in the therapeutic setting    clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of  patient  	0
 these cells relay messages   in the form of action potentials   as you learned when studying biopsychology     to the central nervous system  	0
 the conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction  	1
 sometimes   we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect  difference between them  	1
 this is known as the just noticeable difference   jnd   or difference threshold  	0
 unlike the absolute threshold   the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity  	0
 on the other hand   how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge   our experiences   and our thoughts  	1
 this is called top   down processing  	0
 if so   then you have experienced how motivation to detect  meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between  true sensory stimulus and background noise  	0
 the ability to identify  stimulus when it is embedded in  distracting background is called signal detection theory  	1
 this might also explain why  mother is awakened by  quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep  	0
 two physical characteristics of  wave are amplitude and wavelength <link>  	0
 the amplitude of  wave is the height of  wave as measured from the highest point on the wave   peak or crest   to the lowest point on the wave   trough    	1
 wavelength refers to the length of  wave from one peak to the next  	1
 the visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see  	1
 as <link> shows   the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays      rays   ultraviolet light   visible light   infrared light   microwaves   and radio waves  	0
 this is known as the timbre of  sound  	0
 timbre refers to  sound   purity   and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency   amplitude   and timing of sound waves  	1
 it serves as  barrier between the inner eye and the outside world   and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye  	0
 the pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes   and the size of the pupil can change as  function of light levels as well as emotional arousal  	1
 when light levels are low   the pupil will become dilated   or expanded   to allow more light to enter the eye  	0
 the lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects  	0
 in  normal   sighted individual   the lens will focus images perfectly on  small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea   which is part of the retina   the light   sensitive lining of the eye  	1
 the fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells <link>  	0
 while cones are concentrated in the fovea   where images tend to be focused   rods   another type of photoreceptor   are located throughout the remainder of the retina  	0
 rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions   and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones   they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field  	1
 the optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at  point called the optic chiasm  	1
 as <link> shows   the optic chiasm is an    shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain  	0
 the trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory   another major theory of color vision is known as the opponent   process theory  	0
 we use  variety of cues in  visual scene to establish our sense of depth  	0
 some of these are binocular cues   which means that they rely on the use of both eyes  	1
 one example of  binocular depth cue is binocular disparity   the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives  	1
 the inner ear contains the semi   circular canals   which are involved in balance and movement   the vestibular sense     and the cochlea  	0
 the cochlea is  fluid   filled   snail   shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells   hair cells   of the auditory system <link>  	1
 we  ll discuss two of them here   temporal theory and place theory  	0
 the temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of  sensory neuron  	1
 this would mean that  given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave  	0
 localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields  	0
 like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth   the auditory system uses both monaural   one   eared   and binaural   two   eared   cues to localize sound  	1
 deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear  	1
 some people are born deaf   which is known as congenital deafness  	1
 when the hearing problem is associated with  failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain   it is called sensorineural hearing loss  	1
 one disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is m ni re   disease  	0
 this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids   but some individuals might be candidates for  cochlear implant as  treatment option  	0
 cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of  microphone    speech processor   and an electrode array  	1
 the device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain  	0
 you have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste   sweet   salty   sour   and bitter  	0
 research demonstrates   however   that we have at least six taste groupings  	0
 umami is our fifth taste  	0
 olfactory receptor cells are located in  mucous membrane at the top of the nose  	1
 small hair   like extensions from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical receptors located on these extensions <link>  	0
 these receptors include meissner   corpuscles   pacinian corpuscles   merkel   disks   and ruffini corpuscles  	0
 meissner   corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations   and pacinian corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations  	1
 merkel   disks respond to light pressure   while ruffini corpuscles detect stretch   abraira   ginty   <num>    	1
 there are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin   each attuned to specific touch   related stimuli  	0
 generally speaking   pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature  	0
 pain that signals some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain  	1
 in some situations   pain results from damage to neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system  	0
 the vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture  	1
 as <link> shows   the major sensory organs   utricle   saccule   and the three semicircular canals   of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear  	0
 one gestalt principle is the figure   ground relationship  	0
 according to this principle   we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground  	1
 two additional gestalt principles are the law of continuity   or good continuation   and closure  	0
 the law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous   smooth flowing lines rather than jagged   broken lines <link>  	1
 you probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world   but this is not always the case  	0
 our perceptions are based on perceptual hypotheses   educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information  	1
 these hypotheses are informed by  number of factors   including our personalities   experiences   and expectations  	0
 both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with  	0
 reflexes are  motor or neural reaction to  specific stimulus in the environment  	1
 they tend to be simpler than instincts   involve the activity of specific body parts and systems      the knee   jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light     and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system      the spinal cord and the medulla    	0
 our minds have  natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence  	0
 associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment  	1
 you will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter   classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes   operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes   and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes   both conscious and unconscious  	0
 pavlov   <num>   <num>      russian scientist   performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning <link>  	0
 as we discussed briefly in the previous section   classical conditioning is  process by which we learn to associate stimuli and   consequently   to anticipate events  	1
 ivan pavlov   research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning  	0
 pavlov would sound  tone   like ringing  bell   and then give the dogs the meat powder <link>  	0
 the tone was the neutral stimulus   ns     which is  stimulus that does not naturally elicit  response  	1
 prior to conditioning   the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs  	0
 tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the   squeak   of the cabinet  	0
 pairing  new neutral stimulus     squeak     with the conditioned stimulus     zzhzhz     is called higher   order conditioning   or second   order conditioning  	1
 this means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus   the squeaky cabinet <link>  	0
 soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone  	0
 extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus  	1
 when presented with the conditioned stimulus alone   the dog   cat   or other organism would show  weaker and weaker response   and finally no response  	0
 on the other hand   when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus   it is called stimulus generalization   the opposite of stimulus discrimination  	1
 the more similar  stimulus is to the condition stimulus   the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response  	0
 his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect   which was first proposed by psychologist edward thorndike  	0
 according to the law of effect   behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated   and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated   thorndike   <num>    	1
 essentially   if an organism does something that brings about  desired result   the organism is more likely to do it again  	0
 remember that reinforcement   even when it is negative   always increases  behavior  	0
 in contrast   punishment always decreases  behavior  	1
 in positive punishment   you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease  behavior  	1
 shapingin his operant conditioning experiments   skinner often used an approach called shaping  	0
 instead of rewarding only the target behavior   in shaping   we reward successive approximations of  target behavior  	1
 why is shaping needed  	0
 with  variable interval reinforcement schedule   the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time   which are unpredictable  	1
 say that manuel is the manager at  fast   food restaurant  	0
 although strict behaviorists such as skinner and watson refused to believe that cognition   such as thoughts and expectations   plays  role in learning   another behaviorist   edward ctolman   had  different opinion  	0
 tolman   experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement   tolman   honzik   <num>   tolman   ritchie     kalish   <num>    	0
 previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning   which are forms of associative learning  	0
 in observational learning   we learn by watching others and then imitating   or modeling   what they do or say  	1
 the individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models  	1
 bandura and other researchers proposed  brand of behaviorism called social learning theory   which took cognitive processes into account  	0
 according to bandura   pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement  	0
 he felt that internal mental states must also have  role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation  	0
 what are the implications of this study  	0
 bandura concluded that we watch and learn   and that this learning can have both prosocial and antisocial effects  	0
 prosocial   positive   models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior  	0
 the different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts  	0
 concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information   images   ideas   or memories   such as life experiences  	1
 concepts are   in many ways   big ideas that are generated by observing details   and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures  	0
 an artificial concept   on the other hand   is  concept that is defined by  specific set of characteristics  	1
 various properties of geometric shapes   like squares and triangles   serve as useful examples of artificial concepts  	0
 thus   lexicon is  language   vocabulary  	1
 grammar refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon   fern ndez   cairns   <num>    	1
 for instance   english grammar dictates that most verbs receive an    ed   at the end to indicate past tense  	0
 semantics and syntax are part of  language   grammar  	0
 semantics refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words  	1
 syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences   chomsky   <num>   fern ndez   cairns   <num>    	1
 bfskinner   <num>   proposed that language is learned through reinforcement  	0
 noam chomsky   <num>   criticized this behaviorist approach   asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically determined  	0
 the use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow  very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds  	0
 different strategies have different action plans associated with them <link>  	0
 for example    well   known strategy is trial and error  	0
 the old adage     if at first you do   succeed   try   try again   describes trial and error  	0
 the realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias  	0
 an anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making  decision or solving  problem  	1
 in this case   you  re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point  	0
 the confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs  	1
 hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable   even though it really was    	1
 in other words   you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did  	0
 representative bias describes  faulty way of thinking   in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something   for example   you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation   because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors  	1
 motivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward  goal  	1
 in addition to biological motives   motivations can be intrinsic   arising from internal factors   or extrinsic   arising from external factors   <link>  	1
 intrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring   while extrinsically motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others  	1
 according to the drive theory of motivation   deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs  	1
 these needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and   ultimately   bring the system back to homeostasis  	0
 self   efficacy is an individual   belief in her own capability to complete  task   which may include  previous successful completion of the exact task or  similar task  	1
 albert bandura   <num>   theorized that an individual   sense of self   efficacy plays  pivotal role in motivating behavior  	0
 in the <num>   raymond cattell proposed  theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components   crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence   cattell   <num>    	0
 crystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it  	1
 when you learn   remember   and recall information   you are using crystallized intelligence  	0
 practical intelligence   as proposed by sternberg   is sometimes compared to   street smarts  	0
 being practical means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences  	1
 this type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of iq   individuals who score high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence   sternberg   <num>    	0
 multiple intelligences theory was developed by howard gardner    harvard psychologist and former student of erik erikson  	0
 gardner   theory   which has been refined for more than <num> years   is  more recent development among theories of intelligence  	0
 creativity is the ability to generate   create   or discover new ideas   solutions   and possibilities  	1
 very creative people often have intense knowledge about something   work on it for years   look at novel solutions   seek out the advice and help of other experts   and take risks  	0
 for most people   once they have eaten   they feel satiation   or fullness and satisfaction   and their eating behavior stops  	0
 like the initiation of eating   satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms  	0
 our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of activity   but our body   metabolic rate also comes into play  	0
  person   metabolic rate is the amount of energy that is expended in  given period of time   and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic rates  	1
 people with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates of metabolism  	0
 according to the centers for disease control and prevention   cdc     an adult with  body mass index   bmi   between <num> and <num> is considered overweight <link>  	1

 people who are so overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese  	1
 prader   willi syndrome   pws   is  genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and reduced rates of metabolism  	1
 typically   affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that they do not engage in excessive eating  	0
 anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of  body weight well below average through starvation and or excessive exercise  	1
 individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa often have  distorted body image   referenced in literature as  type of body dysmorphia   meaning that they view themselves as overweight even though they are not  	0
 kinsey also developed  continuum known as the kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize an individual   sexual orientation   jenkins   <num>    	1
 sexual orientation is an individual   emotional and erotic attractions to same   sexed individuals   homosexual     opposite   sexed individuals   heterosexual     or both   bisexual    	1
 based on these observations   masters and johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are fairly similar in men and women   excitement   plateau   orgasm   and resolution <link>  	1
 the excitement phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle   and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal  	1
 during plateau   women experience further swelling of the vagina and increased blood flow to the labia minora   and men experience full erection and often exhibit pre   ejaculatory fluid  	1
 in men   pelvic contractions are accompanied by  buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles        ejaculation    	0
 resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by  decrease in blood pressure and muscular relaxation  	1
 while many women can quickly repeat the sexual response cycle   men must pass through  longer refractory period as part of resolution  	0
 when individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex   then they experience gender dysphoria  	0
 gender dysphoria is  diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders   dsm <num>   that describes individuals who do not identify as the gender that most people would assume they are  	1
 this dysphoria must persist for at least six months and result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet dsm <num> diagnostic criteria  	0
 as  result   the test was normed and standardized   which means that the test was administered consistently to  large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in  bell curve   bell curves will be discussed later    	0
 standardization means that the manner of administration   scoring   and interpretation of results is consistent  	1
 norming involves giving  test to  large population so data can be collected comparing groups   such as age groups  	1
 without  large sample size   it is less likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population  	0
  representative sample is  subset of the population that accurately represents the general population  	1
 if   for example   you measured the height of the women in your classroom only   you might not actually have  representative sample  	0
 the schachter   singer two   factor theory of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience  	0
 according to this theory   emotions are composed of two factors   physiological and cognitive  	1

 memory is an information processing system   therefore   we often compare it to  computer  	0
 memory is the set of processes used to encode   store   and retrieve information over different periods of time <link>  	1
 encoding involves the input of information into the memory system  	1
 storage is the retention of the encoded information  	1
 it probably required  lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information  	1
 this is known as effortful processing <link>  	0
 craik and tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding   especially if we apply what is called the self   reference effect  	0

 for example   the endocrinologist hans selye    famous stress researcher   once defined stress as the   response of the body to any demand   whether it is caused by   or results in   pleasant or unpleasant conditions     selye   <num>   <num>    	1
 selye   definition of stress is response   based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body   physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it  	0
 two kinds of appraisals of  stressor are especially important in this regard   primary and secondary appraisals  	0
  primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well   being that  stressor might entail  	1
  stressor would likely be appraised as  threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm   loss   or other negative consequence   conversely    stressor would likely be appraised as  challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth  	0
  person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game   meaning he feels fully energized   focused   and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency  	0
 but when stress exceeds this optimal level   it is no longer  positive force   it becomes excessive and debilitating   or what selye termed distress   from the latin dis     bad      	1
 people who reach this level of stress feel burned out   they are fatigued   exhausted   and their performance begins to decline  	0
 your heart starts to pound and speeds up   you begin to breathe heavily and perspire   you get butterflies in your stomach   and your muscles become tense   preparing you to take some kind of direct action  	0
 cannon proposed that this reaction   which he called the fight   or   flight response   occurs when  person experiences very strong emotions   especially those associated with  perceived threat   cannon   <num>    	1
 during the fight   or   flight response   the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system <link>  	0
 the general adaptation syndrome   shown in <link>   consists of three stages     <num>   alarm reaction     <num>   stage of resistance   and   <num>   stage of exhaustion   selye   <num>   <num>    	0
 alarm reaction describes the body   immediate reaction upon facing  threatening situation or emergency   and it is roughly analogous to the fight   or   flight response described by cannon  	1
 during an alarm reaction   you are alerted to  stressor   and your body alarms you with  cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation  	0
 what goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress  	0
 the physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex   but they generally involve the work of two systems   the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic   pituitary   adrenal   hpa   axis  	0
 when  person first perceives something as stressful   selye   alarm reaction     the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands  	0

 in the <num>   psychiatrists thomas holmes and richard rahe wanted to examine the link between life stressors and physical illness   based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in  person   normal life routines are stressful   whether these events are desirable or undesirable  	0
 they developed the social readjustment rating scale   srrs     consisting of <num> life events that require varying degrees of personal readjustment   holmes   rahe   <num>    	0
 potential stressors do not always involve major life events  	0
 daily hassles   the minor irritations and annoyances that are part of our everyday lives      rush hour traffic   lost keys   obnoxious coworkers   inclement weather   arguments with friends or family     can build on one another and leave us just as stressed as life change events <link>   kanner   coyne   schaefer     lazarus   <num>    	0

 shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division   which includes growth and proliferation of new cells   thereby leading to more rapid aging   sapolsky   <num>    	0
 in the study   researchers compared telomere lengths in the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children   epel et al  <num>    	0
 mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of healthy children  	0
 these individuals tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in  rush  	1
 according to friedman and rosenman   these individuals exhibit type  behavior pattern   those who are more relaxed and laid   back were characterized as type  <link>  	1

 psychoanalysis was developed by sigmund freud and was the first form of psychotherapy  	0
 it was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early <num>th century   but it has since waned significantly in popularity  	0
 freud suggested that during this patient   therapist relationship   the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist   maybe positive feelings   maybe negative feelings  	0
 freud called this transference   the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient   other relationships to the psychoanalyst  	1
 for example   crystal is seeing  psychoanalyst  	0
 in psychoanalysis   therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings  	1
 in behavior therapy    therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors   rather than digging deeply into one   unconscious  	1
 two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy  	0
 aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior  	1
 therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors   such as smoking   nail biting   and drinking  	0
 sometimes   it   too impractical   expensive   or embarrassing to re   create anxiety   producing situations   so  therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using  simulation to help conquer fears  	0
 virtual reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of public speaking   claustrophobia   fear of enclosed spaces     aviophobia   fear of flying     and post   traumatic stress disorder   ptsd      trauma and stressor   related disorder   gerardi   cukor   difede   rizzo     rothbaum   <num>    	1

 humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential  	1
 so it makes sense that the goal of humanistic therapy is to help people become more self   aware and accepting of themselves  	0
 in contrast to psychoanalysis   humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts  	0
 in active listening   the therapist acknowledges   restates   and clarifies what the client expresses  	0
 therapists also practice what rogers called unconditional positive regard   which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they are  	1
 rogers   <num>   also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness   empathy   and acceptance toward their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves   which results in personal growth  	0
 as we learned in the previous section   stress   especially if it is chronic   takes  toll on our bodies and can have enormously negative health implications  	0
 when we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful   it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress  	0
 these efforts may include avoiding   minimizing   or distancing oneself from the problem   or positive comparisons with others        not as bad off as she is       or seeking something positive in  negative event     now that   ve been fired    can sleep in for  few days      	0
 in some cases   emotion   focused coping strategies involve reappraisal   whereby the stressor is construed differently   and somewhat self   deceptively   without changing its objective level of threat   lazarus   folkman   <num>    	1
 for example    person sentenced to federal prison who thinks     this will give me  great chance to network with others     is using reappraisal  	0
 building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish  network of close   caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress   sorrow   and fear  	0
 social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends   family   and acquaintances   baron   kerr   <num>    	1
 social support can take many forms   including advice   guidance   encouragement   acceptance   emotional comfort   and tangible assistance   such as financial help    	0
 beyond having  sense of control and establishing social support networks   there are numerous other means by which we can manage stress <link>  	0
  common technique people use to combat stress is exercise   salmon   <num>    	0
 it is well   established that exercise   both of long   aerobic   and short   anaerobic   duration   is beneficial for both physical and mental health   everly   lating   <num>    	0
 the relaxation response approach is conceptualized as  general approach to stress reduction that reduces sympathetic arousal   and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure   benson   proctor   <num>    	1
 another technique to combat stress   biofeedback   was developed by gary schwartz at harvard university in the early <num>  	0

 qualities that help promote psychological well   being      having meaning and purpose in life    sense of autonomy   positive emotions   and satisfaction with life   are linked with  range of favorable health outcomes   especially improved cardiovascular health   mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors   such as diet   physical activity   and sleep quality     boehm   kubzansky   <num>    	0
 the quality that has received attention is positive affect   which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment   such as happiness   joy   enthusiasm   alertness   and excitement   watson   clark     tellegen   <num>    	1
 the characteristics of positive affect   as with negative affect   discussed earlier     can be brief   long   lasting   or trait   like   pressman   cohen   <num>    	0
 by the <num>th century   people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums <link>  	0
 asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological disorders   but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders  	1
 often these people were kept in windowless dungeons   beaten   chained to their beds   and had little to no contact with caregivers  	0
 this legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the united states  	0
 it started the process of deinstitutionalization   the closing of large asylums   by providing for people to stay in their communities and be treated locally  	1

 these individuals are easily distracted   which can make  conversation very difficult  	0
 another cognitive theory of depression   hopelessness theory   postulates that  particular style of negative thinking leads to  sense of hopelessness   which then leads to depression   abramson   metalsky     alloy   <num>    	1
 according to this theory   hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired outcomes will not occur   and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes  	1
 one possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry  	0
 contemporary neurological research shows that disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior   pompili et al   <num>    	0

 in this example   we will call the gene for cleft chin        and the gene for smooth chin     cleft chin is  dominant trait   which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent   bb   or both parents   bb   will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele  	1
 sickle   cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes  	0
 for example   phenylketonuria   pku   is  condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts  	1

 in another approach to gene   environment interactions   the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways  	1
 in other words   researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes  	0
 genes affect more than our physical characteristics  	0
 indeed   scientists have found genetic linkages to  number of behavioral characteristics   ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality   for examples   see mustanski et al   <num>   comings   gonzales   saucier   johnson     macmurray   <num>    	0
 glial cells   which outnumber neurons ten to one   are traditionally thought to play  supportive role to neurons   both physically and metabolically  	0
 glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built   help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication   provide insulation to neurons   transport nutrients and waste products   and mediate immune responses  	1
 neurons   on the other hand   serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system  	0
 like all cells   neurons consist of several different parts   each serving  specialized function <link>  	0
  neuron   outer surface is made up of  semipermeable membrane  	0
 this membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it   while stopping larger or highly charged molecules  	1
 the neuron is  small information processor   and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons  	0
 these signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down  major extension from the soma known as the axon   which ends at multiple terminal buttons  	0
 the terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters   the chemical messengers of the nervous system  	1
 in healthy individuals   the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons   where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse <link>  	0
 the synapse is  very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs  	1
 once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse   they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron  	0
 the neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate    critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra  and extracellular fluids being electrically different  	0
 this difference in charge across the membrane   called the membrane potential   provides energy for the signal  	1
 with this influx of positive ions   the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive  	0
 if that charge reaches  certain level   called the threshold of excitation   the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins many additional pores open   causing  massive influx of na  ions and  huge positive spike in the membrane potential   the peak action potential  	1
 at the peak of the spike   the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open  	0
 because it is all or none   the action potential is recreated   or propagated   at its full strength at every point along the axon  	0
 much like the lit fuse of  firecracker   it does not fade away as it travels down the axon  	0
 agonists are chemicals that mimic  neurotransmitter at the receptor site and   thus   strengthen its effects  	1
 an antagonist   on the other hand   blocks or impedes the normal activity of  neurotransmitter at the receptor  	1
 agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying  person   condition  	0

 this constellation of physiological changes   known as the fight or flight response   allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off  threat or run away to safety  	0
 when the spinal cord is damaged in  particular segment   all lower segments are cut off from the brain   causing paralysis  	0
 therefore   the lower on the spine damage is   the fewer functions an injured individual loses the two hemispheresthe surface of the brain   known as the cerebral cortex   is very uneven   characterized by  distinctive pattern of folds or bumps   known as gyri   singular   gyrus     and grooves   known as sulci   singular   sulcus     shown in <link>  	1
 these gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers  	0
 the two hemispheres are connected by  thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum   consisting of about <num> million axons  	1
 the corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side  	0
 normally   we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day   to   day functions   but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well  	0
 the frontal lobe is involved in reasoning   motor control   emotion   and language  	0
 it contains the motor cortex   which is involved in planning and coordinating movement   the prefrontal cortex   which is responsible for higher   level cognitive functioning   and broca   area   which is essential for language production  	1
 the brain   parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe   and is involved in processing information from the body   senses  	1
 it contains the somatosensory cortex   which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body   such as touch   temperature   and pain  	1
 the temporal lobe is located on the side of the head   temporal means   near the temples       and is associated with hearing   memory   emotion   and some aspects of language  	1
 the auditory cortex   the main area responsible for processing auditory information   is located within the temporal lobe  	1
 wernicke   area   important for speech comprehension   is also located here  	0
 other areas of the forebrainother areas of the forebrain   located beneath the cerebral cortex   include the thalamus and the limbic system  	0
 the thalamus is  sensory relay for the brain  	1
 the limbic system is made up of  number of different structures   but three of the most important are the hippocampus   the amygdala   and the hypothalamus <link>  	0
 the hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory  	1
 the amygdala is involved in our experience of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories  	1
 in <num>   henry gustav molaison   hm  was  <num> year   old man who experienced severe seizures  	0
 in an attempt to control his seizures   hmunderwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala  	0
 the substantia nigra   latin for   black substance     and the ventral tegmental area   vta   are also located in the midbrain <link>  	0
 both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine   and both are critical for movement  	0
 the medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic nervous system   such as breathing   blood pressure   and heart rate  	1
 the word pons literally means   bridge     and as the name suggests   the pons serves to connect the brain and spinal cord  	1
 it also is involved in regulating brain activity during sleep  	0
 brain imagingyou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain  	0
 increasingly   however   we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals who have not suffered brain injury  	0
 in this section   we take  more in   depth look at some of the techniques that are available for imaging the brain   including techniques that rely on radiation   magnetic fields   or electrical activity within the brain  	0
 in magnetic resonance imaging   mri      person is placed inside  machine that generates  strong magnetic field  	1
 the magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body   cells to move  	0
 the endocrine system consists of  series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones <link>  	1
 like neurotransmitters   hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to  receptor in order to send their signal  	1
 the adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response   such as epinephrine   adrenaline   and norepinephrine   noradrenaline    	1
 the pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels   insulin and glucagon  	1
 any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive   strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm  	0
 any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board   irb    	0
 the irb is  committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution   administration   scientists   and community members <link>  	1
 for example   if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire   we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants   responses  	0
 in cases where deception is involved   participants must receive  full debriefing upon conclusion of the study   complete   honest information about the purpose of the experiment   how the data collected will be used   the reasons why deception was necessary   and information about how to obtain additional information about the study  	0
 whereas irbs review research proposals that involve human participants   animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an institutional animal care and use committee   iacuc    	0
 an iacuc consists of institutional administrators   scientists   veterinarians   and community members  	1
 the sign   positive or negative   of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship <link>  	0
  positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction  	1
 put another way   it means that as one variable increases so does the other   and conversely   when one variable decreases so does the other  	0
 however   correlation is limited because establishing the existence of  relationship tells us little about cause and effect  	0
 while variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other   it could also be that some other factor    confounding variable   is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest  	0
 in the ice cream   crime rate example mentioned earlier   temperature is  confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables  	0
 often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid  	0
 or   we have  hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch   ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false   this is known as confirmation bias  	1
 other times   we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind   even if that information is severely limited  	0
 the two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference   experimental manipulation  	0
 the experimental group gets the experimental manipulation   that is   the treatment or variable being tested   in this case   violent tv images     and the control group does not  	1
 since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups   we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance  	0
 by being blind to which child is in which group   we protect against those biases  	0
 this situation is  single   blind study   meaning that one of the groups   participants   are unaware as to which group they are in   experiment or control group   while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group  	0
 to achieve this   we must pay attention to two important variables   or things that can be changed   in any experimental study   the independent variable and the dependent variable  	0
 an independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter  	1
 in  well   designed experimental study   the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups  	0
 if possible   we should use  random sample   there are other types of samples   but for the purposes of this chapter   we will focus on random samples    	0
  random sample is  subset of  larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected  	1
 random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population  	0
 once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups    statistical analysis is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups  	0
  statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance   and thus not meaningful    	0
 reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection  	0
 reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce  given result  	1
 in the context of psychological research   this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent   reproducible ways  	0
 if scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior   focusing attention on such  special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as  whole  	0
 generalizing refers to the ability to apply the findings of  particular research project to larger segments of society  	1
 again   case studies provide enormous amounts of information   but since the cases are so specific   the potential to apply what   learned to the average person may be very limited  	0
 the greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity   or accuracy   of information collected unobtrusively in  natural setting  	0
 having individuals behave as they normally would in  given situation means that we have  higher degree of ecological validity   or realism   than we might achieve with other research approaches  	1
 often   psychologists develop surveys as  means of gathering data  	0
 surveys are lists of questions to be answered by research participants   and can be delivered as paper   and   pencil questionnaires   administered electronically   or conducted verbally <link>  	1
 generally   the survey itself can be completed in  short time   and the ease of administering  survey makes it easy to collect data from  large number of people  	0
 when we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time   we are conducting longitudinal research  	1
 longitudinal research is  research design in which data   gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time  	1
 for example   we may survey  group of individuals about their dietary habits at age <num>   retest them  decade later at age <num>   and then again at age <num>  	0
 in contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others   such as intuition and personal experience   the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support  claim  	0
 scientific knowledge is empirical   it is grounded in objective   tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again   regardless of who is observing while behavior is observable   the mind is not  	1
 if someone is crying   we can see behavior  	0
 facts are observable realities   and opinions are personal judgments   conclusions   or attitudes that may or may not be accurate  	1
 in the scientific community   facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research  	0
 the process of scientific research	0
 scientific knowledge is advanced through  process known as the scientific method  	0
 basically   ideas   in the form of theories and hypotheses   are tested against the real world   in the form of empirical observations     and those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world   and so on  	1
  hypothesis is  testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct   and it is often worded as an if   then statement      if  study all night    will get  passing grade on the test    	1
 the hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world  	0
 psyche comes to represent the human soul   triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness   bulfinch   <num>     in fact   the greek word psyche means soul   and it is often represented as  butterfly  	1
 the word psychology was coined at  time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished   green   <num>    	0
 in most areas of psychology   this means earning  phd in  relevant area of psychology  	0
 literally   phd refers to  doctor of philosophy degree   but here   philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se  	1
 rather   philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in  traditional college of liberal arts and sciences the requirements to earn  phd vary from country to country and even from school to school   but usually   individuals earning this degree must complete  dissertation  	0
 individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning  doctoral degree   which is known as  psyd  	0
  psyd is  doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology  	0
 psyd programs generally place less emphasis on research   oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context   norcorss   castle   <num>    	0
 evolutionary psychology   and specifically   the evolutionary psychology of humans   has enjoyed  resurgence in recent decades  	0

 developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across  lifespan  	1
 developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation  	0
 more recently   the study of personality has taken on  more quantitative approach  	0
 rather than explaining how personality arises   research is focused on identifying personality traits   measuring these traits   and determining how these traits interact in  particular context to determine how  person will behave in any given situation  	0
 personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior   and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals  	1

 we might even describe consciousness as  continuum that ranges from full awareness to  deep sleep  	0
 sleep is  state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness  	1
 wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness   thought   and behavior  	1
 this pattern of temperature fluctuation   which repeats every day   is one example of  circadian rhythm  	0
  circadian rhythm is  biological rhythm that takes place over  period of about <num> hours  	1
 our sleep   wake cycle   which is linked to our environment   natural light   dark cycle   is perhaps the most obvious example of  circadian rhythm   but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate   blood pressure   blood sugar   and body temperature  	0
 the brain   clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus   scn    	0
 the axons of light   sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the scn based on the amount of light present   allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world   klein   moore     reppert   <num>   welsh   takahashi     kay   <num>   <link>  	0

 in addition   the appearance of    complexes is often associated with stage <num> sleep  	0
     complex is  very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli  	1
 thus      complexes might serve as  bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments   hal sz   <num>   steriade   amzica   <num>    	0
 freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams  	0
 manifest content is the actual content   or storyline   of  dream  	1
 latent content   on the other hand   refers to the hidden meaning of  dream  	1
 among  variety of neurobiological evidence   john hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general  	0
 lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during  dream state  	1

  person who has  substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences  	0
 in individuals diagnosed with  substance use disorder   there is  compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions   the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use  	1
 in contrast    person who has psychological dependence has an emotional   rather than physical   need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress  	1
 drug withdrawal includes  variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued  	1
 these symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug  	0
 in recent years   methamphetamine   meth   use has become increasingly widespread  	0
 methamphetamine is  type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available      medications containing pseudoephedrine    compound found in many over   the   counter cold and flu remedies    	1

 this kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids   but some individuals might be candidates for  cochlear implant as  treatment option  	0
 taste   gustation   and smell   olfaction   are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe  	0
 there is  pronounced interaction between our chemical senses  	0
 many species respond to chemical messages   known as pheromones   sent by another individual   wysocki   preti   <num>    	1
 pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of  potential mate  	0
 some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain  	1
 this very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain   or congenital analgesia    	0
 while those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure   they can not experience pain  	0
 wertheimer   and his assistants wolfgang k hler and kurt koffka   who later became his partners   believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli  	1
 this belief led to  new movement within the field of psychology known as gestalt psychology  	0
 the word gestalt literally means form or pattern   but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts  	0
 we might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields  	0
 according to this principle   things that are alike tend to be grouped together <link>  	0
 according to gestalt theorists   pattern perception   or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes   occurs by following the principles described above  	0
 you probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world   but this is not always the case  	0
 built from sensations   but influenced by our own experiences   biases   prejudices   and cultures   perceptions can be very different from person to person  	0
 research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception  	0

 pavlov   <num>   <num>      russian scientist   performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning <link>  	0
 as we discussed briefly in the previous section   classical conditioning is  process by which we learn to associate stimuli and   consequently   to anticipate events  	0
 ivan pavlov   research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning  	0
 the meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus   ucs      stimulus that elicits  reflexive response in an organism  	1
 the dogs   salivation was an unconditioned response   ucr      natural   unlearned   reaction to  given stimulus  	1
 before conditioning   think of the dogs   stimulus and response like this  	0
 eventually   the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone   just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants   footsteps  	0
 the behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response   cr    	1

 taste aversion is  type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus   something ingested   and the unconditioned stimulus   nausea or illness    	1
 here   how it works  	0
 animals   including humans   need to distinguish between stimuli   for example   between sounds that predict  threatening event and sounds that do not   so that they can respond appropriately   such as running away if the sound is threatening    	0
 when an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar   it is called stimulus discrimination  	1

 skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior   the reinforcements and punishments  	0
 his idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect   which was first proposed by psychologist edward thorndike  	0
 according to the law of effect   behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated   and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated   thorndike   <num>    	1
 in negative reinforcement   an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase  behavior  	1
 for example   car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems   which go   beep   beep   beep   until you fasten your seatbelt  	0
 in this case    stimulus   the reprimand   is added in order to decrease the behavior   texting in class    	0

 phonemes are combined to form morphemes   which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning           is both  phoneme and  morpheme    	1
 we use semantics and syntax to construct language  	0
 however   young children master language very quickly with relative ease  	0

 emotions are often thought to be consciously experienced and intentional  	0
 mood   on the other hand   refers to  prolonged   less intense   affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience  	1
 mood states may not be consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion   beedie   terry   lane     devonport   <num>    	0
 other theorists   however   doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience  	0
 thus   the cannon   bard theory of emotion was developed  	0
 according to this view   physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously   yet independently   lang   <num>    	1
 the relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them   and the order in which these occur   remains  topic of research and debate  	0
 lazarus   <num>   developed the cognitive   mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus  	1

 today   we often use the term loosely in describing  variety of unpleasant feeling states   for example   we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated   angry   conflicted   overwhelmed   or fatigued  	0
  useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as  process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well   being   lazarus   folkman   <num>    	0
  critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise   that is   judge   demanding or threatening events   often referred to as stressors     these appraisals   in turn   influence our reactions to such events  	1
 two kinds of appraisals of  stressor are especially important in this regard   primary and secondary appraisals  	0

 one of the early pioneers in the study of stress was walter cannon   an eminent american physiologist at harvard medical school <link>  	0
 in the early part of the <num>th century   cannon was the first to identify the body   physiological reactions to stress  	0
 these physiological reactions were nonspecific   which means that regardless of the type of stressor   the same pattern of reactions would occur  	0
 what selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome   the body   nonspecific physiological response to stress  	1
 if exposure to  stressor continues over  longer period of time   the stage of exhaustion ensues  	0
 at this stage   the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor   the body   ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body   tissues and organs  	1
 in short bursts   this process can have some favorable effects   such as providing extra energy   improving immune system functioning temporarily   and decreasing pain sensitivity  	0
 however   extended release of cortisol   as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress   often comes at  high price  	0
 for an individual to experience stress   he must first encounter  potential stressor  	0

 psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders   including their symptoms   etiology      their causes     and treatment  	1
 violating cultural expectations is not   in and of itself    satisfactory means of identifying the presence of  psychological disorder  	0
 since behavior varies from one culture to another   what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures  	0
 for example   returning  stranger   smile is expected in the united states because  pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures  	0
 how do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not  person   inner states and behaviors truly represent  psychological disorder  	0
 arriving at  proper diagnosis   that is   appropriately identifying and labeling  set of defined symptoms   is absolutely crucial  	1

 the reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor    production innovation first put forth by adam smith   <link>   in his book   the wealth of nations  	0
 adam smithadam smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks  	0
 first   specialization in  particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage  	0
   in later chapters   we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage  	0
 people have different skills   talents   and interests   so they will be better at some jobs than at others  	0
 john maynard keynes   <num>   <num>     one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century   pointed out that economics is not just  subject area but also  way of thinking  	0
 keynes   shown in <link>   famously wrote in the introduction to  fellow economist   book       economics   is  method rather than  doctrine   an apparatus of the mind    technique of thinking   which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions  	0
 in other words   economics teaches you how to think   not what to think  	0
 in  market economy   decision   making is decentralized  	0
 market economies are based on private enterprise   the means of production   resources and businesses   are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals  	1
 businesses supply goods and services based on demand  	0
 it shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for  selection of countries from <num> to <num>   according to an entity known as the world bank  	0

 burgers cost   <num> each   and bus tickets are <num> cents each  	0
 <link> shows alphonso   budget constraint   that is   the outer boundary of his opportunity set  	1
 the opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget  	1
 these decisions do not look back to past choices  	0
 thus   the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs   which are costs that were incurred in the past and can not be recovered   should not affect the current decision  	1
 productive efficiency means that   given the available inputs and technology   it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good  	1
 all choices on the ppf in <link>   including             and    display productive efficiency  	0
 when  country can produce  good at  lower opportunity cost than another country   we say that this country has  comparative advantage in that good  	1

 the first theme is scarcity  	0
 it is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods  	0
 both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or supplied  	0
 price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded   qd   or supplied   qs   and the corresponding percent change in price  	1
 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of  good or service divided by the percentage change in the price  	1
 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories   elastic   inelastic   and unitary  	1
 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one   indicating  high responsiveness to changes in price  	1
 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply  	1
 then   those values can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand   price elasticity of demand     change in quantity   change in price    <num>   <num>	0
 price elasticity of demand     change in quantity   change in price    <num>   <num>	0
 therefore   the elasticity of demand from  to  <num>  	0
 the magnitude of the elasticity has increased   in absolute value   as we moved up along the demand curve from points  to   	0
 recall that the elasticity between these two points was <num>  	0
 infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded   qd   or supplied   qs   changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all  	1
 in both cases   the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in <link>  	0
 while perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic   goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves  	0
 however   in some cases   the price of  key input over which the firm has no control may rise  	0
 for example   many chemical companies use petroleum as  key input   but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil  	0
 coffee shops use coffee as  key input   but they have no control over the world market price of coffee  	0
 however   for  few goods   an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good   for example   those with  higher income might buy fewer hamburgers   because they are buying more steak instead   or those with  higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer  	0
 when the income elasticity of demand is negative   the good is called an inferior good the concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in demand and supply  	1
  higher level of income for  normal good causes  demand curve to shift to the right for  normal good   which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive  	1
 in markets for financial capital   the elasticity of savings   that is   the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates   will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital  	1
 that is  	0
 private enterprise   the ownership of businesses by private individuals   is  hallmark of the us economy  	1
 when people think of businesses   often giants like wal   mart   microsoft   or general motors come to mind  	0
 these two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit   accounting profit and economic profit  	0
 accounting profit is  cash concept  	0
 it means total revenue minus explicit costs   the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out  	1
 however   the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns  	0
 when  firm looks at its total costs of production in the short run    useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories   fixed costs that can not be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed fixed and variable costs	0
 at some point   you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other   way  	0
 in this case   the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease   as shown in the last row of   link  this pattern of diminishing marginal returns is common in production  	0
 as another example   consider the problem of irrigating  crop on  farmer   field  	0
 marginal cost is somewhat different  	0
 marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output  	1
 so it is not the cost per unit of all units being produced   but only the next one   or next few    	0
 this pattern was illustrated earlier in   link  in the middle portion of the long   run average cost curve   the flat portion of the curve around <chem>   economies of scale have been exhausted  	0
 in this situation   allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production   and it is called constant returns to scale  	0
 in this range of the lrac curve   the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls  	0
 when the price of  gallon of gasoline goes up   for example   people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands   commuting by carpool or mass transit   or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home  	0
 economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand  	1
 the law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand   to be explained in the next module   are held constant  	0
 when economists talk about supply   they mean the amount of some good or service  producer is willing to supply at each price  	1
 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of  good or service  	1
 when the price of gasoline rises   for example   it encourages profit   seeking firms to take several actions   expand exploration for oil reserves   drill for more oil   invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline   build new oil refineries   purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations   and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours  	0
 economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied   that  higher price leads to  higher quantity supplied and  lower price leads to  lower quantity supplied   the law of supply  	1
 the law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply   to be explained in the next module   are held constant  	0
 remember this   when two lines on  diagram cross   this intersection usually means something  	0
 the point where the supply curve      and the demand curve      cross   designated by point  in <link>   is called the equilibrium  	1
 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree   that is   where the amount of the product consumers want to buy   quantity demanded   is equal to the amount producers want to sell   quantity supplied    	1
 in fact   at any above   equilibrium price   the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded  	1
 we call this an excess supply or  surplus  	0
  demand curve or  supply curve is  relationship between two   and only two   variables   quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis  	0
 the assumption behind  demand curve or  supply curve is that no relevant economic factors   other than the product   price   are changing  	0
 they will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own  home   and so on  	0
  product whose demand falls when income rises   and vice versa   is called an inferior good  	1
 in other words   when income increases   the demand curve shifts to the left  	0
 other goods are complements for each other   meaning that the goods are often used together   because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other  	1
 examples include breakfast cereal and milk   notebooks and pens or pencils   golf balls and golf clubs   gasoline and sport utility vehicles   and the five   way combination of bacon   lettuce   tomato   mayonnaise   and bread  	0
 in thinking about the factors that affect supply   remember what motivates firms   profits   which are the difference between revenues and costs  	1
 goods and services are produced using combinations of labor   materials   and machinery   or what we call inputs or factors of production  	1
 if  firm faces lower costs of production   while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged    firm   profits go up  	0
 how can an economist sort out all these interconnected events  	0
 the answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption  	0
 look at how each economic event affects each market   one event at  time   holding all else constant  	1
 price controls come in two flavors  	0
  price ceiling keeps  price from rising above  certain level   the   ceiling       while  price floor keeps  price from falling below  certain level   the   floor      	1
 this section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings  	0
 if nurses   salaries in minneapolis   st paul   bloomington are higher than in other cities   more nurses will move to minneapolis   st paul   bloomington to find jobs   more people will be willing to train as nurses   and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as  full   time job  	0
 in other words   there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area  	0
 at equilibrium   the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal  	1
 thus   every employer who wants to hire  nurse at this equilibrium wage can find  willing worker   and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find  job  	0
 the labor market   however   presents some prominent examples of price floors   which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low   paid workers  	0
 the us government sets  minimum wage    price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than  certain hourly rate  	1
 in mid  <num>   the us minimum wage was raised to   <num> per hour  	0
 many states do have usury laws   which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge  	1
 however   in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate  	0

 jos  wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility   which is the term economists use to describe  person   level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices let   begin with an assumption   which will be discussed in more detail later   that jos  can measure his own utility with something called utils  	1
   it is important to note that you can not make comparisons between the utils of individuals   if one person gets <num> utils from  cup of coffee and another gets <num> utils   this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much  	0
 another way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar  	0
 marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional utility jos  receives given the price of the product  	1
 for jos       shirts and movies   the marginal utility per dollar is shown in <link>  	0
 let   begin with  concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices  	0
 <link> shows  budget constraint that represents kimberly   choice between concert tickets at   <num> each and getting away overnight to  bed   and   breakfast for   <num> per night  	0
 kimberly has   <num> <num> per year to spend between these two choices  	0
  choice like  means that  rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline   while  choice like  would mean that  rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline  	0
 goods where demand declines as income rises   or conversely   where the demand rises as income falls   are called   inferior goods  	1
 an inferior good occurs when people trim back on  good as income rises   because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer  	0
 for example    higher   income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy  used car   and instead eat more steak and buy  new car  	0
 rates of saving in america have never been especially high   but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years   as the data from the bureau of economic analysis in <link> show  	0
  decision about how much to save can be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint  	0
 household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor   leisure decision  	0
 this insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with  higher rate of return  	0
 for example   individual retirement accounts   iras   and <num>    accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later   after retirement  	1
 the main difference between these accounts is that an ira is usually set up by an individual   while  <num>    needs to be set up through an employer  	0
 another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting   or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values  	1
 economists typically consider dollars to be fungible   or having equal value to the individual   regardless of the situation  	0
 you might   for instance   think of the   <num> you found in the street differently from the   <num> you earned from three hours working in  fast food restaurant  	0
  perfectly competitive firm is known as  price taker   because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market  	1
 if  firm in  perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as  penny   it will lose all of its sales to competitors  	0
 <link> presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in <link>  	0
 the marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit  	1
 as mentioned before    firm in perfect competition faces  perfectly elastic demand curve for its product   that is   the firm   demand curve is  horizontal line drawn at the market price level  	0
 but in the long run   firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output   and some firms will cease production altogether  	0
 the long   run process of reducing production in response to  sustained pattern of losses is called exit  	1
 the following clear it up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from   and the reasons why some firms go out of business  	0
 why do firms cease to exist  	0
 for  constant cost industry   whenever there is an increase in market demand and price   then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms   entry and stops at the point where the new long   run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before  	1
 but why will costs remain the same  	0
 when profit   maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility   maximizing consumers   something remarkable happens   the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency   terms that were first introduced in   choice in  world of scarcity    	0
 productive efficiency means producing without waste   so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier  	1
 in the long run in  perfectly competitive market   because of the process of entry and exit   the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long   run average cost curve  	0
 these profits should attract vigorous competition as described in perfect competition   and yet   because of one particular characteristic of monopoly   they do not  	0
 barriers to entry are the legal   technological   or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering  market  	1
 barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable   such as the cost of renting retail space   to the extremely restrictive  	0
 economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition  	0
   this theme was introduced in cost and industry structure    	0

 at  lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission   so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism  	0
 the same thing happened to local service   especially in recent years   with the growth in cellular phone systems  	0
 the combination of improvements in production technologies and  general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to  wave of deregulation   starting in the late <num> and continuing into the <num>  	0
 this wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter   the prices that could be charged   and the quantities that could be produced in many industries   including telecommunications   airlines   trucking   banking   and electricity  	0
 but  monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs   because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience  	0
  monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit   maximizing combination of quantity and price  	1
 allocative efficiency is  social concept  	0
 it refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output   the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost  	1
 one type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic competition  	0
 monopolistically competitive markets feature  large number of competing firms   but the products that they sell are not identical  	1
  firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways   physical aspects of the product   location from which the product is sold   intangible aspects of the product   and perceptions of the product  	1
 products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called differentiated products  	0
 as an example of  profit   maximizing monopolistic competitor   consider the authentic chinese pizza store   which serves pizza with cheese   sweet and sour sauce   and your choice of vegetables and meats  	0
 although authentic chinese pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants   it has  differentiated product  	0
 as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits   new competitors will continue to enter the market   reducing the original firm   demand and marginal revenue curves  	0
 the long   run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point    where the firm   perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve  	1
 when price is equal to average cost   economic profits are zero  	0
 critics of market   oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles  	0
 they argue that much of the cost of creating such  high degree of product differentiation   and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation   is socially wasteful   that is   most people would be just as happy with  smaller range of differentiated products produced and sold at  lower price  	0
 defenders of  market   oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names   no one is forcing them to do so  	0
 quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve   which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms   and they need not produce differentiated products    	0
 again   smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete   while additional large firms would produce such  high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at  profitable price  	0
 in the united states   as well as many other countries   it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti   competitive behavior   which is  violation of antitrust law  	0
 both the antitrust division of the justice department and the federal trade commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the united states  	0
 the prisoner   dilemma is  scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self   interest  	1
 it applies well to oligopoly  	0
 if  group of us companies signed such  contract   however   it would be illegal  	0
 certain international organizations   like the nations that are members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries   opec     have signed international agreements to act like  monopoly   hold down output   and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports  	0
 such agreements   however   because they fall in  gray area of international law   are not legally enforceable  	0
 thus   if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel   but do not match price increases   then none of the oligopolists will have  strong incentive to change prices   since the potential gains are minimal  	0
 this strategy can work like  silent form of cooperation   in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output   increase price   and share  monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement  	0
 the laws that give government the power to block certain mergers   and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones   are called antitrust laws  	1
 before  large merger happens   the antitrust regulators at the ftc and the us department of justice can allow the merger   prohibit it   or allow it if certain conditions are met  	0
 also in <num>   the federal trade commission   ftc   was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair  	1
 in <num>   the celler   kefauver act extended the clayton act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers  	0
 in the twenty   first century   the ftc and the us department of justice continue to enforce antitrust laws  	0
 another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the herfindahl   hirschman index   hhi    	0
 the hhi   as it is often called   is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry   as the following work it out shows  	1
 for more on the difficulties of defining markets   refer to monopoly  	0
 this new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies   instead of defining  market and counting up total sales  	0
  common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real   world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves faced by the firms that are proposing the merger  	0
  second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry  	0
 an exclusive dealing agreement between  manufacturer and  dealer can be legal or illegal  	0
 it is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers  	0
 computer software manufacturers may often bundle together  number of different programs   even when the buyer wants only  few of the programs  	0
 think about the software that is included in  new computer purchase   for example  	0
 recall from the chapter on monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm   or firms   reacts to  new firm by dropping prices very low   until the new firm is driven out of the market   at which point the existing firm raises prices again  	0
 this pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market  	0
 so what then is the appropriate competition policy for  natural monopoly  	0
 <link> illustrates the case of natural monopoly   with  market demand curve that cuts through the downward   sloping portion of the average cost curve  	0
 points          and  illustrate four of the main choices for regulation  	0
 thus   in the <num> and <num>   some regulators of public utilities began to use price cap regulation   where the regulator sets  price that the firm can charge over the next few years  	1
  common pattern was to require  price that declined slightly over time  	0
  number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as enron   tyco international   and worldcom led to the sarbanes   oxley act in <num>  	0
 sarbanes   oxley was designed to increase confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud  	1
 in this case   the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange   but you have no voice in their market transaction  	0
 the effect of  market exchange on  third party who is outside or   external   to the exchange is called an externality  	1
 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved   they are sometimes called spillovers externalities can be negative or positive  	0
 if you hate country music   then having it waft into your house every night would be  negative externality  	0
 if you love country music   then what amounts to  series of free concerts would be  positive externality  	0
 now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution   that is   the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make  refrigerator   but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution  	0
 if the firm is required to pay   <num> for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces  refrigerator   production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by   <num>  	0
 in <num>   the environmental protection agency   epa   was created to oversee all environmental laws  	1
 in the same year   the clean air act was enacted to address air pollution  	1
 just two years later   in <num>   congress passed and the president signed the far   reaching clean water act  	0
 <link> illustrates the marginal costs that  firm faces in reducing pollution  	0
 the marginal cost of pollution reduction   like most most marginal cost curves increases with output   at least in the short run  	0

 coase pointed out that this issue can not be resolved until property rights are clearly defined   that is   the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation  	1
 does the farmer have  property right not to have  field burned  	0
 <link> illustrates  theoretical model of this situation  	0
 when the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive   for example   at quantity qa   there are usually  lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution   and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high  	0
 at qa   it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution  	0
 although  nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders   no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world  	0
 global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires  difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities  	0
 if nations such as china   india   brazil   mexico   and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats   then the world   high   income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases  	0
 economists do not have  great deal to say about the choice between           and  in <link>   all of which lie along the production possibility frontier  	0
 countries with low per capita gross domestic product   gdp     such as china   place  greater emphasis on economic output   which in turn helps to produce nutrition   shelter   health   education   and desirable consumer goods  	0
 countries with higher income levels   where  greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life   may be willing to place  relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection  	0
 market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because  firm can earn higher profits by finding  way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want  	0
 as gregory lee   ceo of samsung said     relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover  world of possibilities with technology  	0
 an innovative firm knows that it will usually have  temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above   normal profits before competitors can catch up  	0
 if  firm builds  factory or buys  piece of equipment   the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments  	0
 however   when  firm invests in new technology   the private benefits   or profits   that the firm receives are only  portion of the overall social benefits  	0
 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product   whether enjoyed by other companies or society as  whole   as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology  	1
 the social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug  	1
 if big drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies   its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve dsocial   and it would be willing to borrow and invest   <num> million  	0
 however   if big drug is receiving only <num> cents of each dollar of social benefits   the firm will not spend as much on creating new products  	0
 after all   positive externalities exist from investment in education  	0
 while not always easy to measure   according to walter mcmahon   the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population   lower levels of crime    cleaner environment and  more stable   democratic government  	1
 for these reasons   many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary   secondary   and higher education  	0
 state and federal governments support research in  variety of ways  	0
 for example   united for medical research    coalition of groups that seek funding for the national institutes of health     which is supported by federal grants     states     nih   supported research added   <num> billion to our gdp and supported seven million jobs in <num> alone  	1
 the united states remains the leading sponsor of medical   related research spending   <num> billion in <num>  	0
 other institutions   such as the national academy of scientists and the national academy of engineers   receive federal grants for innovative projects  	0
 what about  situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit  	1
 this kind of good is called  public good  	0
 spending on national defense is  good example of  public good  	0
 when individuals make decisions about buying  public good    free rider problem can arise   in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to   free ride   on the purchases of others  	1
 comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues   economic inequality and poverty  	0
 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below  certain level of income   called the poverty line   that defines the income needed for  basic standard of living  	1
 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below  certain level of income   called the poverty line   that defines the income needed for  basic standard of living  	1
 in the united states   the official definition of the poverty line traces back to  single person   mollie orshansky  	0

 the us government has implemented  number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who have incomes just above the poverty line   who are referred to as the near   poor  	1
 such programs are called the safety net   in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income  	0
 from the great depression of the <num> until <num>   the united states   most visible antipoverty program was aid to families with dependent children   afdc     which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line  	1
 this program was often just called   welfare   in <num>   congress passed and president bill clinton signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act   more commonly called the   welfare reform act   the new law replaced afdc with temporary assistance for needy families   tanf    	0
 often called   food stamps     supplemental nutrition assistance program   snap   is  federally funded program   started in <num>   in which each month poor people receive  card like  debit card that they can use to buy food  	1
 the amount of food aid for which  household is eligible varies by income   number of children   and other factors but   in general   households are expected to spend about <num>   of their own net income on food   and if <num>   of their net income is not enough to purchase  nutritionally adequate diet   then those households are eligible for snap  	0
 snap can contribute to the poverty trap  	0
 medicaid was created by congress in <num> and is  joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government  	1
 the federal government helps fund medicaid   but each state is responsible for administering the program   determining the level of benefits   and determining eligibility  	0
 for example   you could draw  bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution  	0
 <link> presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called  lorenz curve  	0

  labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively   rather than as individuals  	1
 thus   negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called collective bargaining the subject of labor unions can be controversial  	1
 supporters of labor unions view them as the workers   primary line of defense against efforts by profit   seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits  	0
 two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record   keeping and computer   operated cabs for loading and unloading ships   changes which the union opposed   along with overtime pay  	0
 president obama threatened to use the labor management relations act of <num>   commonly known as the taft   hartley act   where  court can impose an <num>   day   cooling   off period   in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of  work stoppage  	1

 in august <num>   many members of the us congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and hold town hall   style meetings to discuss president obama   proposed changes to the us healthcare system  	1
 this was officially known as the patient protection and affordable care act   ppaca   or as the affordable care act   aca     but was more popularly known as obamacare  	0
 the bill   opponents   claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add   <num> billion to the deficit   to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so   called   death panels   that decide which critically   ill patients receive care and which do not  	0
 also   the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information   in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction  	1
 let   begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods   labor   and financial capital markets  	0
 the presence of imperfect information can easily cause  decline in prices or quantities of products sold  	0
  market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as  thin market  	1
 by contrast    market with many buyers and sellers is called  thick market  	1
 when imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating   markets may become extremely thin as  relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on  price  	0
   if only you knew more economics   you would not be so irrational     is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying  	0
  group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion   because so much of this so   called   quirky   behavior is extremely common among us  	0
 for example    conventional economist would say that if you lost    <num> bill today   and also got an extra   <num> in your paycheck   you should feel perfectly neutral  	0
 sellers may offer  warranty   which is  promise to fix or replace the good   at least for  certain period of time  	1
 the seller may also offer  buyer  chance to buy  service contract   where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for  set time period  	1
 service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars   appliances and even houses  	0
 in the financial capital market   before  bank makes  loan   it requires  prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income   in addition   the bank conducts  credit check on the individual   past borrowing  	0
 another approach is to require  cosigner on  loan   that is   another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so  	1
 insurance is  method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having  significant detrimental financial effect  	1
 generally   households or firms with insurance make regular payments   called premiums  	1
 unemployment insurance   employers in every state pay  small amount for unemployment insurance   which goes into  fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for  period of time   usually six months   after they lose their jobs  	1
 workman   compensation insurance   employers are required by law to pay  small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds   typically run at the state level   that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job  	1
 moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance  	1
 for example   if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor   you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require  doctor   visit  	0
 health insurance policies often have  copayment   in which the policyholder must pay  small amount   for example    person might have to pay   <num> for each doctor visit   and the insurance company would cover the rest  	1
 another method of cost   sharing is coinsurance   which means that the insurance company covers  certain percentage of the cost  	1
 for example   insurance might pay for <num>   of the costs of repairing  home after  fire   but the homeowner would pay the other <num>    	0
 adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high   risk or low   risk than the insurance company does  	1
 this creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high   risk tend to want to buy more insurance   without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk  	0

 banks offer  range of accounts to serve different needs  	0
  checking account typically pays little or no interest   but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money   either by writing  check or by using  debit card   that is    card which works like  credit card   except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through  credit card company    	1

  savings account typically pays some interest rate   but getting the money typically requires you to make  trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine   or you can access the funds electronically    	1
 in part   this safety arises because  bank account offers more security than keeping  few thousand dollars in the toe of  sock in your underwear drawer  	0
 in addition   the federal deposit insurance corporation   fdic   protects the savings of the average person  	1
 every bank is required by law to pay  fee to the fdic   based on the size of its deposits  	0
 this is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity  	0
 the bond has  coupon rate or interest rate   which is usually semi   annual   but can be paid at different times throughout the year  	0
   bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest  	0
 the bond yield measures the rate of return  bond is expected to pay over time  	1
 bonds are bought not only when they are issued   they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes  	0
 an individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions  	0
 thus    standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification   which means buying stocks or bonds from  wide range of companies  	1
  saver who diversifies is following the old proverb     do   put all your eggs in one basket   in any broad group of companies   some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse   but the extremes have  tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value  	0

 as this example suggests   we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution   the problem called regulatory capture   which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy    	0
 in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes   or rules for safety in the workplace   or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations   you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma  	0
 the political pressure to pass  prescription drug benefit for medicare was apparently quite high   while the political pressure to assist the <num> million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower  	0
 one reason might be that senior citizens are represented by aarp    well   funded and well   organized lobbying group   while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance  	0
 for example   policies that impose price controls   like rent control   may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords  	0

 democracy is sometimes summed up   and oversimplified   in two words     majority rule  	1
 when voters face three or more choices   however   then voting may not always be  useful way of determining what the majority prefers  	0
 the situation in which choice  is preferred by  majority over choice    choice  is preferred by  majority over choice    and choice  is preferred by  majority over choice  is called  voting cycle  	1
 it is easy to imagine sets of government choices   say   perhaps the choice between increased defense spending   increased government spending on health care   and  tax cut   in which  voting cycle could occur  	0

 this demand can be divided into four main parts   consumer spending   consumption     business spending   investment     government spending on goods and services   and spending on net exports  	1
   see the following clear it up feature to understand what is meant by investment  	0
 the net export component of gdp is equal to the dollar value of exports      minus the dollar value of imports                 	1
 the gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance  	1
 if  country   exports are larger than its imports   then  country is said to have  trade surplus  	1
 indeed   the trade deficit grew quite large in the late <num> and in the mid  <num>  	0
 <link>      also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades   even after the declines during the great recession between <num> and <num>  	0
 as noted before   if exports and imports are equal   foreign trade has no effect on total gdp  	0
 to avoid this problem   which would overstate the size of the economy considerably   government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption   investment   government   and trade purposes  	0
 intermediate goods   which are goods that go into the production of other goods   are excluded from gdp calculations  	1
 net national product   nnp   is calculated by taking gnp and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out   or reduced in value because of aging   over the course of  year  	1
 the process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation  	1
 similarly   if you do not know the rate of inflation   it is difficult to figure out if  rise in gdp is due mainly to  rise in the overall level of prices or to  rise in quantities of goods produced  	0
 the nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time  	1
 the real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation  	1
 <link> shows the us nominal and real gdp since <num>  	0
 because <num> is the base year   the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year  	0
  significant decline in real gdp is called  recession  	1
 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called  depression  	1
 the severe drop in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the <num> is clearly visible in the figure   as is the great recession of <num>   <num>  	0
 thus    recession lasts from peak to trough   and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak  	0
 the movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle  	1
 it is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough   to   peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since <num>  	0
 exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country    currency that need to be traded for  single unit of country    currency   for example   japanese yen per british pound     or as the inverse   for example   british pounds per japanese yen    	1
 two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose   market exchange rates and purchasing power parity   ppp   equivalent exchange rates  	0

 as women are now in the labor force   many of the services they used to produce in the non   market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy   which makes the gdp appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed  	0
 before the last two centuries   although rulers   nobles   and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level   the average person   standard of living had not changed much for centuries  	0
 progressive   powerful economic and institutional changes started to have  significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  	0
 according to the dutch economic historian jan luiten van zanden   slavery   based societies   favorable demographics   global trading routes   and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the industrial revolution to succeed  	0
 the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power   driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the <num>  	1
 economic growth depends on many factors  	0
 key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by  country   government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently  	0
 laws must be clear   public   fair   enforced   and equally applicable to all members of society  	0
 the second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change  	0
 technological change is  combination of invention   advances in knowledge   and innovation   which is putting that advance to use in  new product or service  	1
 for example   the transistor was invented in <num>  	0
 while productivity growth was high in <num> and <num>   around <num>       it has slowed down since then  	0
 productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages  	0
 over time   the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce  	0
 the category of technology is the   joker in the deck  	0
 earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation  	0
 when most people think of new technology   the invention of new products like the laser   the smartphone   or some new wonder drug come to mind  	0
 when society increases the level of capital per person   the result is called capital deepening  	1
 the idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker  	0
 some low   income and middle   income economies around the world have shown  pattern of convergence   in which their economies grow faster than those of high   income countries  	0
 gdp increased by an average rate of <num>   per year in the <num> and <num>   per year from <num> to <num> in the high   income countries of the world   which include the united states   canada   the countries of the european union   japan   australia   and new zealand  	0
 how did these incomes increase  	0
 the neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital  	1
 also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence  	0
 there are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed   though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be  	0
 additionally   there are individuals who are underemployed  	0
 this includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in  lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills  	0
 there does not seem to be  long   term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower  	0

 one primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy  	0
 if firms believe that business is expanding   then at any given wage they will desire to hire  greater quantity of labor   and the labor demand curve shifts to the right  	0
 in other words   these people are involuntarily unemployed  	0
 what causes involuntary unemployment  	0
 one argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract   which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble   and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong  	0
 this wage   setting behavior acts like  form of insurance   the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times   but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times  	0
 the insider   outsider model of the labor force   in simple terms   argues that those already working for firms are   insiders     while new employees   at least for  time   are   outsiders  	1
  firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization   to be familiar with routine procedures   to train new employees   and so on  	0
 however   cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm   productivity and prospects finally   the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see  decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such  decline   there is no obvious way for  decentralized economy to implement such  plan  	1
 in  market economy   some companies are always going broke for  variety of reasons   old technology   poor management   good management that happened to make bad decisions   shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm   product is desired    large customer who went broke   or tough domestic or foreign competitors  	0
 conversely   other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees  	0
 however   adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly  	0
 wages are typically reviewed only once or twice  year  	0
 in many modern jobs   it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level  	0
 sure   the average worker in <num> is better educated and more productive than the average worker in <num>   but not six times more productive  	0
 sure   per capita gdp increased substantially from <num> to <num>   but is the average person in the us economy really more than eight times better off in just <num> years  	0
 not likely  	0
  modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand  	0
 to simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods   the price level in each period is typically reported as an index number   rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods  	0
 price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time  	1
 the cpi is calculated by government statisticians at the us bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in  fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four  	0
 in recent years   the statisticians have paid considerable attention to  subtle problem   that the change in the total cost of buying  fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living   because the cost of living represents how much it costs for  person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility  	0
 as we  ve learned   cpi measures prices as they affect everyday household spending  	1
 well    core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the cpi and excluding volatile economic variables  	1
 in this way   economists have  better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living  	0
 there is an international price index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported  	1
 an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market  	1
 the gdp deflator   measured by the bureau of economic analysis   is  price index that includes all the components of gdp   that is   consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports    	1
 times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower   as in the recession of <num>   <num>   the great depression   the recession of <num>   <num>   and the great recession in <num>   <num>  	0
 there were  few months in <num> that were deflationary   but not at an annual rate  	0
 what are the economic problems caused by inflation   and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public  	0
 consider  very short story     the land of funny money  	0
 the problem of  good   looking nominal interest rate being transformed into an ugly   looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes  	0
 the us income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms   without an adjustment for inflation  	0
 the worker invests these funds in  wide range of investment vehicles  	0
 these plans are tax deferred   and they are portable so that if the individual takes  job with  different employer   their <num>    comes with them  	0
 to the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return   retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners however   ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation  	0
 inflation can make long   term planning difficult  	0
 in discussing unintended redistributions   we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with  pension that is fixed in nominal terms and  high rate of inflation  	0
 similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement   because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation can not be known with certainty  	0
 an indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation  	1
  wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in private markets and government programs  	0
 since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another   say   increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive   indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation  	0
 the social security program offers two examples of indexing  	0
 since the passage of the social security indexing act of <num>   the level of social security benefits increases each year along with the consumer price index  	0
 also   social security is funded by payroll taxes   which are imposed on the income earned up to  certain amount     <num> <num> in <num>  	1
 the balance of trade   or trade balance   is any gap between  nation   dollar value of its exports   or what its producers sell abroad   and  nation   dollar worth of imports   or the foreign   made products and services that households and businesses purchase  	1
 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports   the economy is said to have  trade surplus  	1
 if imports exceed exports   the economy is said to have  trade deficit  	1
  few decades ago   it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes   trains   and trucks between countries as  way of measuring the balance of trade  	1
 this measurement is called the merchandise trade balance  	0
 in most high   income economies   including the united states   goods make up less than half of  country   total production   while services compose more than half  	0
 statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the bureau of economic analysis   bea   within the us department of commerce   using  variety of different sources  	0
 the final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers   which are payments made by government   private charities   or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received  	1
 economic or military assistance from the us government to other countries fits into this category   as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities  	0
 the story of robinson and friday also provides  good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage   which you learn more about in the international trade chapter  	0
 the following work it out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the united states and great britain in the <num>  	0
 calculating comparative advantage	0
 the national saving and investment identity provides  useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance  	0
 in  nation   financial capital market   the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments  	0
 when the trade deficit rises   it necessarily means  greater net inflow of foreign financial capital  	0
 the national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways  	0
  nation   level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade   but these two are actually quite separate  	0
 it is perfectly possible for  country to have  very high level of trade   measured by its exports of goods and services as  share of its gdp   while it also has  near   balance between exports and imports  	0
  high level of trade indicates that  good portion of the nation   production is exported  	1
 the next three chapters take up this task  	0
 this chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand   how the two interact to reach  macroeconomic equilibrium   and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium  	0
 this chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy   growth   unemployment   and inflation     and provides  framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals  	1
 the bottom line remains   however   that every sale represents income to someone   and so   say   law argues    given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy  	1
 because jean   baptiste say   adam smith   and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as   classical   economists   modern economists who generally subscribe to the say   law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists  	1
 if supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level   then   as say himself recognized   it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur  	0
 to be sure   even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand   the economy could still experience  situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses  	0
 the alternative to say   law   with its emphasis on supply   can be named keynes   law     demand creates its own supply  	1
 as  matter of historical accuracy   just as jean   baptiste say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as say   law   john maynard keynes never wrote down keynes   law   but the law is  useful simplification that conveys  certain point of view  	0
 when keynes wrote his great work the general theory of employment   interest   and money during the great depression of the <num>   he pointed out that during the depression   the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much  	0
 real gdp   firms will produce and sell  	0
 the aggregate supply   as   curve shows the total quantity of output   real gdp   that firms will produce and sell at each price level  	1
 <link> shows an aggregate supply curve  	0
 aggregate demand   ad   refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy  	1
   strictly speaking   ad is what economists call total planned expenditure  	0
 us exports will be relatively more expensive   and the quantity of exports sold will fall  	0
 us imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper   so the quantity of imports will rise  	0
 thus    higher domestic price level   relative to price levels in other countries   will reduce net export expenditures  	0
 in the long run   the most important factor shifting the as curve is productivity growth  	0
 productivity means how much output can be produced with  given quantity of labor  	1
 when consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy   they tend to consume more  	1
 if business confidence is high   then firms tend to spend more on investment   believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial  	0
 conversely   if consumer or business confidence drops   then consumption and investment spending decline  	0
 during  recession   when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses   the us congress often passes tax cuts  	0
 during the recession of <num>   for example    tax cut was enacted into law  	0
 in many of the national economies across europe   the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about <num>   or  bit lower   even in good economic years  	0
 this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year   in and year   out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to  matching of workers and employers in the labor market  	1
 potential gdp can imply different unemployment rates in different economies   depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy  	1
 now   focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the sras curve   which is the near   vertical portion on the right   hand side  	0
 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like en where output is at or near potential gdp   then the size of potential gdp pretty much determines the level of output in the economy  	0
 because ad is volatile   it can easily fall  	0
 thus   even if we start at yp   if ad falls   then we find ourselves in what keynes termed  recessionary gap  	0
 the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment   as shown at <chem> in the <link>  	0
 nondurable goods are things like groceries   once you consume them   they are gone  	1
 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy   like healthcare or entertainment keynes identified three factors that affect consumption  	0
 just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes   so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items  	0
 the cost of investment thus includes the interest rate  	0
 even if the firm has the funds   the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital  	1
 first   aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment  	0
 second   the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices   which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand  	1
 we will consider these two claims in turn   and then see how they are represented in the ad   as model the first building block of the keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed  	1
 in fact   if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all   the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential gdp   as shown in <link>  	0
 this outcome is an important example of  macroeconomic externality   where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level  	1
 for example    firm should respond to  decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales  	0
 in the <num>      	0
 phillips   an economist at the london school of economics   was studying the keynesian analytical framework  	0
 the second is changes in people   expectations about inflation  	0
 in other words   there may be  tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation   but when they realize inflation is occurring   the tradeoff disappears  	0
 both factors   supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations   cause the aggregate supply curve   and thus the phillips curve   to shift  	0
 in this situation   unemployment is low   but inflationary rises in the price level are  concern  	0
 the keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy   using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift ad to the left  	0
 the result would be downward pressure on the price level   but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment  	0
 the key policy implication is this   should the government focus more on long   term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment  	0
 this focus on long   run growth rather than the short   run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long   run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run  	0
 let   consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn   and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand   aggregate supply model the importance of potential gdp in the long run	0
 growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology  	0
 physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done  	1
 compare   for example   your productivity in typing  term paper on  typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software  	0
 keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential gdp takes  very long time   then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical  	0
 in response to those immortal words of john maynard keynes     in the long run we are all dead     neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as   say   ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy  	0
 since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time   the only advantage of  keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work  	1
 is that the likely outcome keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize  situation of too little or too much aggregate demand   and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending   all enacted in  timely fashion  	1
 after all   neoclassical economists argue   it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of gdp so that politicians know whether  recession is occurring   and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later  	0
 the macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at  variety of different price levels   and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation  	0
 the great economist milton friedman   <num>   <num>   summed up the neoclassical view of the long   term phillips curve tradeoff in  <num> speech        here is always  temporary trade   off between inflation and unemployment   there is no permanent trade   off  	0
 if aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model   in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures  	0
 <link> shows  vertical lras curve and three different levels of aggregate demand   rising from <chem> to <chem> to <chem>  	0
 instead   many mainstream economists believe both the keynesian and neoclassical perspectives  	0
 robert solow   the nobel laureate in economics in <num>   described the dual approach in this way  	0
 economies without money typically engage in the barter system  	0
 barter   literally trading one good or service for another   is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in  modern advanced economy  	1
 in an economy without money   an exchange between two people would involve  double coincidence of wants    situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide  	1
 second   money must serve as  store of value  	0
 in  barter system   we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services  	0
 loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future  	1
 so money serves all of these functions   it is  medium of exchange   store of value   unit of account   and standard of deferred payment  	1
 as economies grew and became more global in nature   the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome  	0
 countries moved towards the use of fiat money  	0
 fiat money has no intrinsic value   but is declared by  government to be the legal tender of  country  	1
 there are two definitions of money   <chem> and <chem> money supply  	0
 <chem> money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash   checkable   demand   deposits   and traveler   checks <chem> money supply is less liquid in nature and includes <chem> plus savings and time deposits   certificates of deposits   and money market funds  	1
 <chem> money supply includes coins and currency in circulation   the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the us treasury   at the federal reserve bank   or in bank vaults  	0
 closely related to currency are checkable deposits   also known as demand deposits  	0
 for example   <chem> includes savings deposits in banks   which are bank accounts on which you can not write  check directly   but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank  	1
 many banks and other financial institutions also offer  chance to invest in money market funds   where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in  safe way   such as short   term government bonds  	1
 another ingredient of <chem> are the relatively small   that is   less than about   <num> <num>   certificates of deposit   cds   or time deposits   which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for  certain period of time   ranging from  few months to  few years   in exchange for  higher interest rate  	1
 it is important to note that in our definition of money   it ischeckable deposits that are money   not the paper check or the debit card  	0
 although you can make  purchase with  credit card   it is not considered money but rather  short term loan from the credit card company to you  	0
 when you make  purchase with  credit card   the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller   and at the end of the month   the credit card company sends you  bill for what you have charged that month  	0
 banks are  critical intermediary in what is called the payment system   which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets  	1
 also   those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in  bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at  later date  	0
 banks are  financial intermediary   that is   an institution that operates between  saver who deposits money in  bank and  borrower who receives  loan from that bank  	1
 financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds   but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions   which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans  	1
 all the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool   which is then loaned out  	0
  bank   balance sheeta balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities  	1
 an asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something  	1
 for example   the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition  	0
  bank   balance sheet operates in much the same way  	0
  bank   net worth is also referred to as bank capital  	1
  bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults   monies that the bank holds at the federal reserve bank   called   reserves       loans that are made to customers   and bonds  	1
 the second category of bank asset is bonds   which are  common mechanism for borrowing   used by the federal and local government   and also private companies   and nonprofit organizations  	1
  bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds   typically bonds issued by the us government  	0
 the bank will be more willing to make what are called   subprime loans     which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down   payment   little scrutiny of whether the borrower has  reliable income   and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that  	1
 some subprime loans made in the mid <num> were later dubbed ninja loans   loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated no income   no job   or assets  	0
 these subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities   but with  twist  	0
 the idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage   backed securities   certain investors would agree to take the first   say   <num>   of such losses  	0
 fortunately    formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in  banking system  	0

 some prominent central banks around the world include the european central bank   the bank of japan   and the bank of england  	0
 in the united states   the central bank is called the federal reserve   often abbreviated as just   the fed   this section explains the organization of the us federal reserve and identifies the major responsibilities of  central bank  	1
 bank regulation is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk  	1
 regulation falls into  number of categories   including reserve requirements   capital requirements   and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make  	0
 they are allowed to purchase us treasury securities but   to protect depositors   they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky bank capital is the difference between  bank   assets and its liabilities  	1
 in other words   it is  bank   net worth  	0
  bank must have positive net worth   otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt   meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities  	0
 in this situation   whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money   and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough   lost their money  	0
 depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits   as shown in <link> is called  bank run  	1
 in the movie it    wonderful life   the bank manager   played by jimmy stewart   faces  mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money   but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw  portion of their deposits   using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon  	0
 to prevent this   the fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they can not obtain funds from anywhere else  	1
 this is known as the lender of last resort role  	0
 for banks   the central bank acting as  lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money  	0
 the federal open market committee   fomc   makes the decisions regarding these open market operations  	1
 the fomc is made up of the seven members of the federal reserve   board of governors  	0
  second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement   which   as we noted earlier   is the percentage of each bank   deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank  	1
 if banks are required to hold  greater amount in reserves   they have less money available to lend out  	0
 if banks are allowed to hold  smaller amount in reserves   they will have  greater amount of money available to lend out  	0
  monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy  	1
 conversely    monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is  contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy  	1
 this module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand   and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation  	0
 if the economy is suffering  recession and high unemployment   with output below potential gdp   expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential gdp  	0

 different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure  	0
 quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways  	0
 first   it involved the fed purchasing long term treasury bonds   rather than short term treasury bills  	1
 in <num>   however   it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get  	0
 if the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level   the central bank can not force individual banks to make loans  	0
 similarly   sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in  recession   because they recognize that firms   sales and employees   jobs are more insecure in  recession   and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments  	0
 the result is that during an especially deep recession   an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp  	0
 specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used  	0
 consider the velocity of <chem>   the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances  	0
 in <num>   for example   <chem> was   <num> trillion and nominal gdp was   <num> trillion   so the velocity of <chem> was <num>     <num> trillion     <num> trillion    	0
 this equation is sometimes called the basic quantity equation of money but   as you can see   it is just the definition of velocity written in  different form  	0
 this equation must hold true   by definition  	0
 in the <num>   when velocity as measured by <chem> seemed predictable    number of economists   led by nobel laureate milton friedman   <num>   <num>     argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at  constant growth rate  	0
 these economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy   and the political pressures on central bankers   central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects  	0
 this vision of focusing monetary policy on  low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the <num> to have their bank practice inflation targeting   which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low  	1
 by <num>   central banks in <num> countries   including austria   brazil   canada   israel   korea   mexico   new zealand   spain   sweden   thailand   and the united kingdom faced  legal requirement to target the inflation rate  	0
 one long   standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future  	0
 for example   from <num> to <num> during what was known as the   dot   com   boom   the us stock market   which is measured by the dow jones industrial index   which includes <num> very large companies from across the us economy     nearly tripled in value  	1
 the nasdaq index   which includes many smaller technology companies   increased in value by  multiple of five from <num> to <num>  	0
 at  broader level   some economists worry about  leverage cycle   where   leverage   is  term used by financial economists to mean   borrowing   when economic times are good   banks and the financial sector are eager to lend   and people and firms are eager to borrow  	1
 remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by  money multiplier    process of loans being made   money being deposited   and more loans being made  	1
 in good economic times   this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth  	0
 sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor  	0
 for example   ecuador   el salvador   and panama have decided to dollarize   that is   to use the us dollar as their currency  	1
 sometimes nations share  common currency  	0
 in foreign exchange markets   demand and supply become closely interrelated   because  person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency   and vice versa  	0
 to get  sense of this   it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market     <num>   firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services     <num>   tourists visiting other countries     <num>   international investors buying ownership   or part   ownership   of  foreign firm     <num>   international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership  	0
 let   consider these categories in turn  	0
 let   say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth   and not take  risk that the euro will be worth less in us dollars than it currently is  	0
 you can hedge   which means using  financial transaction to protect yourself against  risk from one of your investments   in this case   currency risk from the contract    	1
 specifically   you can sign  financial contract and pay  fee that guarantees you  certain exchange rate one year from now   regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time  	0
 when the prices of most goods and services change   the price is said to   rise   or   fall   for exchange rates   the terminology is different  	0
 when the exchange rate for  currency rises   so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies   it is referred to as appreciating or   strengthening   when the exchange rate for  currency falls   so that  currency trades for less of other currencies   it is referred to as depreciating or   weakening  	1
 to illustrate the use of these terms   consider the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar since <num>   shown in <link>       	0
 the vertical axis in <link>      shows the price of   <num> in us currency   measured in terms of canadian currency  	0
 in the actual foreign exchange market   almost all of the trading for mexican pesos is done for us dollars  	0
 what factors would cause the demand or supply to shift   thus leading to  change in the equilibrium exchange rate  	0
 the answer to this question is discussed in the following section  	0
 the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity   ppp   exchange rate  	1
 the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity   ppp   exchange rate  	1
  group of economists at the international comparison program   run by the world bank   have calculated the ppp exchange rate for all countries   based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods  	0
 foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency  	0
 as  result   movements in exchange rates can have  powerful effect on incentives to export and import   and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as  whole  	0
 banks play  vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers  	0
 when most of  country   largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously    sharp decline in aggregate demand and  deep recession results  	0
 since the main responsibilities of  central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable    central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country   existing banks into bankruptcy  	0
 in <num>   there was  drastic depreciation of the yen   relative to the us dollar   by about <num>   and again at the end of the year in <num> also by about <num>    	0
   source   federal reserve economic data   fred   <link>   the line   variations represent the volatility of exchange rates  	0
  soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market   but in some cases   especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction   the central bank will intervene in the market  	1
 with  hard peg exchange rate policy   the central bank sets  fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate  	1
  central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies  	0
 brazil   central bank can use  contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates   which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets   and lead to an appreciation  	0
 alternatively   brazil   central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market  	0
 another issue arises when  central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market  	0
 if  central bank ends up in  situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets   it will be buying the currency of other countries   like us dollars or euros   to hold as reserves  	0
 holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost   and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit  	0
 taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as tobin taxes   named after james tobin   the <num> nobel laureate in economics who proposed such  tax in  <num> lecture  	1
 for example    government might tax all foreign exchange transactions   or attempt to tax short   term portfolio investment while exempting long   term foreign direct investment  	0
  final approach to exchange rate policy is for  nation to choose  common currency shared with one or more nations is also called  merged currency  	1
  merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether  	0
 in this chapter   we revisit fiscal policy   which was first covered in welcome to economics  	0
 fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy   the other is monetary policy    	0
 while monetary policy is made by policymakers at the federal reserve   fiscal policy is made by congress and the president the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand  	1
 all government spending and taxes affect the economy   but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government  	0
 conversely   when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in  year   it runs  budget surplus  	1
 if government spending and taxes are equal   it is said to have  balanced budget  	1
 for example   in <num>   the us government experienced its largest budget deficit ever   as the federal government spent   <num> trillion more than it collected in taxes  	0
 together   the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about <num>   of federal tax revenues in <num>  	0
 although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax   nearly three   quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes the income tax is  progressive tax   which means that the tax rates increase as  household   income increases  	1
 taxes also vary with marital status   family size   and other factors  	0
 the medicare payroll tax is also called  proportional tax   that is    flat percentage of all wages earned  	1
 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit   but above that level it becomes  regressive tax   meaning that people with higher incomes pay  smaller share of their income in tax  	1
 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit   but above that level it becomes  regressive tax   meaning that people with higher incomes pay  smaller share of their income in tax  	1
 as  share of gdp   the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time   from about <num>   of gdp in the <num> to roughly <num>   by <num>   according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office  	0
 the government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation   either after death or during life in the form of gifts  	0
 these estate and gift taxes collected about <num>   of gdp in the first decade of the <num>  	0
 graphically   we see that fiscal policy   whether through change in spending or taxes   shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy  	1
 <link> illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand   aggregate supply diagram in  growing economy  	0
 the stimulus package of <num> is an example  	0
 changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically   due to automatic stabilizers   such as unemployment insurance and food stamps   which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in  recession and hold down aggregate demand in  potentially inflationary boom  	1
 because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets   it not only affects aggregate demand   it can also affect interest rates  	0
 in <link>   the original equilibrium   <chem>   in the financial capital market occurs at  quantity of   <num> billion and an interest rate of <num>    	1
 many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time  	0
 the time to get  bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag  	1
 finally   once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs  	0
 also   the government is not  household for many reasons   one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities  	0
 the argument of keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind   spending when times are hard and saving when times are good   for the sake of the overall economy  	1
 the national saving and investment identity must always hold true because   by definition   the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal  	0
 however   the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit  	0
 for example   in <num> and <num>   the us government had budget surpluses   although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits  	0
 how will this affect interest rates in financial markets  	0
 in <link>   the original equilibrium   <chem>   where the demand curve   <chem>   for financial capital intersects with the supply curve   <chem>   occurs at an interest rate of <num>   and an equilibrium quantity equal to <num>   of gdp  	0
 however   as the government budget deficit increases   the demand curve for financial capital shifts from <chem> to <chem>  	0
 if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp   threatening an inflationary increase in price levels   the central bank may react with  contractionary monetary policy  	0
 in this situation   the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy   and the government borrowing might crowd out  great deal of private investment  	0
 on the other hand   if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp   an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of  danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy  	0
 in this situation   higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy   and there would be little crowding out of private investment  	0
 however   even  central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity  	0
 the theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth   century economist david ricardo   <num>   <num>    	1
 if ricardian equivalence holds completely true   then in the national saving and investment identity   any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by  corresponding change in private saving  	0
 first   banks in turkey borrow in  widely used currency like us dollars or euros   then convert those us dollars to lira   and then lend the money to borrowers in turkey  	0
 if the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates   then turkey   banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in us dollars or euros  	0
 the combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand   which causes  deep recession  	0
 many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years   along with turkey in <num>   this general pattern was followed by mexico in <num>   thailand and countries across east asia in <num>   <num>   russia in <num>   and argentina in <num>  	0
 for example   life expectancy at birth in many low   income regions approximates those who are more affluent  	0
 the data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living  	0
 for instance   despite very high income levels   there is still undernourishment in europe and north america  	0
 the world   great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the <num> with that group of nations sometimes known as the east asian tigers   south korea   thailand   malaysia   indonesia   and singapore  	1
 the list sometimes includes hong kong and taiwan   although these are often treated under international law as part of china   rather than as separate countries  	0
 for unemployment caused by  recession   the keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available  	0
 the monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward   run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans   drive down interest rates   and increase aggregate demand  	0
 in  recession   there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off   and so even  central bank   with fighting inflation as its top priority   can usually justify some reduction in interest rates with regard to fiscal policy   the automatic stabilizers discussed in government budgets and fiscal policy should be allowed to work   even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession  	0
 there is less agreement over whether   in addition to automatic stabilizers   governments in  recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases  	0
 in the case of the great recession   the case for this kind of extra   aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger   but for  smaller recession   given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy   discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution  	0
 however   the aftermath of the recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off  recession like flipping  switch turns off  lamp  	0
 likewise   interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent  	0
 it is clearly possible   and perhaps sometimes necessary   for  converging economy   the economy of  country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders   to live with  degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high   income economies  	1
 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that  trade deficit exists when  nation   imports exceed its exports  	0
 in order for  trade deficit to take place   foreign countries must provide loans or investments   which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually   that the deficit will become  surplus    	0
 it would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy   shifting the short   term aggregate supply curve to the left  	0
 the result could be  burst of inflation and   if the federal reserve were to run  tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation   it could also lead to recession  	0
 people sometimes talk as if the us economy   with its great size   is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets  	0
 world war  severed many economic connections  	0
 during the great depression of the <num>   many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others  	0
 world war ii further hindered international trade  	0
 recall from the chapter choice in  world of scarcity that  country has  comparative advantage when  good can be produced at  lower cost in terms of other goods  	0
 the question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this     what do we give up to produce this good    	0
 it should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in  world of scarcity  	0
 the united states produces   consumes <num> barrels of oil and <num> bushels of corn  	0
 given their current production levels   if the united states can trade an amount of corn fewer than <num> bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than <num> barrels   it will gain from trade  	0
 with trade   the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade  	0
 then   in the numerical example given   mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced <num> <num> pairs of shoes but only <num> <num> refrigerators  	0
 thus   if mexico can export no more than <num> <num> pairs of shoes   giving up <num> <num> pairs of shoes   in exchange for imports of at least <num> <num> refrigerators    gain of <num> <num> refrigerators     it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade  	0
 mexico will be unambiguously better off  	0
 what can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars   computers   machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the united states   the european union   and japan  	0
 there are two reasons     <num>   the division of labor leads to learning   innovation   and unique skills   and   <num>   economies of scale  	0
  second broad reason that intra   industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale  	0
 the concept of economies of scale   as introduced in cost and industry structure   means that as the scale of output goes up   average costs of production decline   at least up to  point  	1
 <link> illustrates economies of scale for  plant producing toaster ovens  	0
 tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for  variety of reasons  	1
 some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries   for humanitarian reasons   and protecting against dumping  	0
 traditionally   tariffs were used simply as  political tool to protect certain vested economic   social   and cultural interests  	0
 recall from international trade that tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services  	0
 they make imports more expensive for consumers   discouraging imports  	0
   we  ll cover the gatt in more detail later in the chapter  	0
 this agreement has since been superseded by the world trade organization   wto     whose membership includes about <num> nations and most of the economies of the world  	0
 it is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules   including rules about tariffs   quotas   and nontariff barriers  	1
 there are  number of reasons   but one of them will surprise you   the trade policies of the high   income countries  	0
 even when their climate and land are well   suited to products like cotton   rice   sugar   or milk   farmers in low   income countries find it difficult to compete  	0
 farm subsidies in the high   income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce  	0
 this increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production  	0
 one concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high   skilled   high   wage workers in the united states   it may also impose costs on low   skilled   low   wage workers  	0
 after all   high   skilled us workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers   machinery   and pharmaceuticals in which the united states has  comparative advantage  	0
 however   bhutanese politicians   business leaders   and workers hope that if the local industry had  chance to get established   before it needed to face international competition   then  domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills   management   technology   and economies of scale that it needs to become  successful profit   earning domestic industry  	0
 thus   the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for  limited time   to give the infant industry time to mature   before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy  	1
   revisit macroeconomic policy around the world for more information on the infant industry argument  	0
 anti   dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production  	1
 since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization   wto     nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file  complaint with the wto  	0
 anti   dumping complaints have risen in recent years   from about <num> cases per year in the late <num> to about <num> new cases each year by the late <num>  	0
 in general   high   income countries such as the united states   canada   japan   and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards  	0
 in contrast   middle  and low   income countries like brazil   nigeria   india   and china have lower environmental standards  	0
 the general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is  luxury   as soon as their people have enough to eat   decent healthcare   and longer life expectancies   then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants   scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks   national parks to protect wildlife   and so on  	0
 the world trade organization   wto   was officially born in <num>   but its history is much longer  	0
 in the years after the great depression and world war ii   there was  worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together  	0
 the best known of these regional trading agreements is the european union  	0
 in the years after world war ii   leaders of several european nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely   they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war  	0
 in other words   the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on  belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs   indeed   the story of technotron begins with  particular disruptive market change    new technology   that causes real tradeoffs  	0
 in thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade   or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter   the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism   but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues   while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur  	0
 the  term in the equation for the line is the slope  	0
 remember that slope is defined as rise over run   more specifically   the slope of  line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis  	0
 in this example   each time the  term increases by one   the run     the  term rises by three  	0
 one common line graph is called  time series   in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable  	1
 thus    time series graph shows how  variable changes over time  	0
 economists use  vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people   preferences  	0
 in consumer choices   the level of utility that  person receives is described in numerical terms  	0
 this appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences   called indifference curves   which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility  	0
 thus   the marginal utility that lilly would gain from   say   increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from <num> to <num>   so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points  and   	0
 indeed   the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution   which is the rate at which  person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same  	1
 indifference curves like um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right  	0
  rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right  	0
 in graphical terms   the new budget constraint will now be tangent to  higher indifference curve   representing  higher level of utility  	0
  reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left   which will cause it to be tangent to  lower indifference curve   representing  reduced level of utility  	0
 the price of haircuts rises to   <num>  	0
 ogden starts at choice  on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference curve  	0
 after the price of pizza increases   he chooses  on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve  	0
 the price of  stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm  	0
 the concept of  present discounted value   pdv     which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for  stream of expected future payments   can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds  	1
 to place  present discounted value on  future payment   think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal  certain amount in the future  	0
 the keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion  	0
 the first is  vertical line showing the level of potential gdp  	0
 potential gdp means the same thing here that it means in the ad   as diagrams   it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital the second conceptual line on the keynesian cross diagram is the <num> degree line   which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right  	1
 <link> shows an investment function where the level of investment is   for the sake of concreteness   set at the specific level of <num>  	0
 just as  consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real gdp   or national income     the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real gdp  	0
 imports are <num> of real gdp in this example   and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column  	0
 the final column   aggregate expenditures   sums up               	0
 this aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in <link>  	0
 in this situation   the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for gdp to reach its full employment level   and unemployment will occur  	0
 the distance between an output level like <chem> that is below potential gdp and the level of potential gdp is called  recessionary gap  	0
 because the equilibrium level of real gdp is so low   firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers   and unemployment will be high  	0
 the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency  	0
 one typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing  cost on another  	1
 remember   the demand curve traces consumers   willingness to pay for different quantities  	0
 the amount that individuals would have been willing to pay   minus the amount that they actually paid   is called consumer surplus  	1
 consumer surplus is the area labeled    that is   the area above the market price and below the demand curve  	0
 consumer and producer surplus the somewhat triangular area labeled by  shows the area of consumer surplus   which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay  	0
 first   an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced  	0
 the loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss  	1
 in  very real sense   it is like money thrown away that benefits no one  	0
 the demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply   but by the interaction between the two  	0
 in <num>   the famous economist alfred marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined  price was like arguing   whether it is the upper or the under blade of  pair of scissors that cuts  piece of paper  	0
 in many cases    business that focuses on one or  few products   sometimes called its   core competency     is more successful than firms that try to make  wide range of products  	1
 third   specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale   which means that for many goods   as the level of production increases   the average cost of producing each individual unit declines  	0
 for example   if  factory produces only <num> cars per year   each car will be quite expensive to make on average  	0
 for the united states   this is the federal reserve  	0
 fiscal policy   which involves government spending and taxes   is determined by  nation   legislative body  	1
 for the united states   this is the congress and the executive branch   which originates the federal budget  	0
 sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory  	0
 strictly speaking    theory is  more abstract representation   while  model is more applied or empirical representation  	0
 there are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy  	0
 the first is the traditional economy   which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of asia   africa   and south america  	0
 traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done      tradition    	1
 the new york stock exchange   shown in <link>   is  prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together  	0
 in  market economy   decision   making is decentralized  	0
 market economies are based on private enterprise   the means of production   resources and businesses   are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals  	1
 the rise of globalizationrecent decades have seen  trend toward globalization   which is the expanding cultural   political   and economic connections between people around the world  	1
 one measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods   services   and assets across national borders   in other words   international trade and financial capital flows  	0
 imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically  	1
 the size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product   gdp    	1
 thus   the ratio of exports divided by gdp measures what share of  country   total economic production is sold in other countries  	0
 in many cases   it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price  	0
 if your cousin buys  new bicycle for   <num>   then   <num> measures the amount of   other consumption   that he has given up  	0
 the general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring  higher level of utility to  person than consumption of later units is  common pattern  	1
 economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility   which means that as  person receives more of  good   the additional   or marginal   utility from each additional unit of the good declines  	0
 in other words   the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth  	0
 the law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all   or   nothing choices  	0
 the opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up  	0
 just as with alphonso   budget constraint   the opportunity cost is shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier  	0
 by now you might be saying     hey   this ppf is sounding like the budget constraint  	0
 if so   read the following clear it up feature  	0
 in everyday usage   efficiency refers to lack of waste  	0
 an inefficient machine operates at high cost   while an efficient machine operates at lower cost   because it is not wasting energy or materials  	1
 an inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs   while an efficient organization meets schedules   is focused   and performs within budget  	1
 for government   this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm  	0
 at the individual and firm level   the market economy coordinates  process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity   quality   and price that people want  	0
 but for both the government and the market economy in the short term   increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy  	0
 fortunately however   the assumption that individuals are purely self   interested is  simplification about human nature  	0
 in fact   we need to look no further than to adam smith   the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this  	0
 the opening sentence of his book   the theory of moral sentiments   puts it very clearly     how selfish soever man may be supposed   there are evidently some principles in his nature   which interest him in the fortune of others   and render their happiness necessary to him   though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it  	0
 clearly   individuals are both self   interested and altruistic  	0
 the third theme is economic efficiency   or getting the most benefit from scarce resources  	1
 all choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases   there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other  	0
 to find answers to these questions   we need to understand the concept of elasticity  	0
 elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable  	1
 suppose you drop two items from  second   floor balcony  	0
 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of  good or service divided by the percentage change in the price  	1
 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories   elastic   inelastic   and unitary  	1
 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one   indicating  high responsiveness to changes in price  	1
 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply  	0
 unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply   as summarized in <link>  	1
 infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded   qd   or supplied   qs   changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all  	1
 in both cases   the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as shown in <link>  	0
 constant unitary elasticity   in either  supply or demand curve   occurs when  price change of one percent results in  quantity change of one percent  	1
 <link> shows  demand curve with constant unit elasticity  	0
 income elasticity of demand	0
 the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income  	1
 income elasticity of demand     change in quantity demanded   change in incomeincome elasticity of demand     change in quantity demanded   change in income	0
 for most products   most of the time   the income elasticity of demand is positive   that is    rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded  	1
 this pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as normal goods  	0
 however   for  few goods   an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good   for example   those with  higher income might buy fewer hamburgers   because they are buying more steak instead   or those with  higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer  	0
 elasticity in labor and financial capital marketsthe concept of elasticity applies to any market   not just markets for goods and services  	0
 in the labor market   for example   the wage elasticity of labor supply   that is   the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages   will determine the shape of the labor supply curve  	0
 specifically  	0
 if the firm is successful   the outputs are more valuable than the inputs  	0
 this activity of production goes beyond manufacturing      making things    	0
 it includes any process or service that creates value   including transportation   distribution   wholesale and retail sales  	0
 wages that  firm pays its employees or rent that  firm pays for its office are explicit costs  	0
 implicit costs are more subtle   but just as important  	0
 they represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm  	1
 the cost of producing  firm   output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses  	0
  list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast   food meals  	0
 variable costs   on the other hand   are incurred in the act of producing   the more you produce   the greater the variable cost  	1
 labor is treated as  variable cost   since producing  greater quantity of  good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours  	0
 but as output expands still further   the average cost begins to rise  	0
 at the right side of the average cost curve   total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in  	0
 average variable cost obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output  	0
 for example   the variable cost of producing <num> haircuts is   <num>   so the average variable cost is   <num>   <num>   or   <num> per haircut  	0
 average cost tells  firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market  	0
 if we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get average profit   also known as the firm   profit margin  	1
 expanding the equation for profit gives  	0
 while in the short run firms are limited to operating on  single average cost curve   corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen     in the long run when all costs are variable   they can choose to operate on any average cost curve  	0
 thus   the long   run average cost   lrac   curve is actually based on  group of short   run average cost   srac   curves   each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs  	0
 more precisely   the long   run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output  	1
 diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm   not just  large factory  	0
 the leviathan effect can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently   across the entirety of the enterprise  	0
 firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region   thus moving back to  lower average cost at  lower output level  	0

 what  buyer pays for  unit of the specific good or service is called price  	1
 the total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded  	1
  rise in price of  good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service  	0
 the quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period   for example   per day or per year   and over some geographic area   like  state or  country    	0
  demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on  graph like <link>   with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis  	1
   note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable      goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable      goes on the vertical  	0
 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of  good or service  	1
  rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service   while  fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied  	0
 when the price of gasoline rises   for example   it encourages profit   seeking firms to take several actions   expand exploration for oil reserves   drill for more oil   invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline   build new oil refineries   purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations   and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours  	0
 again   price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons  	0
  supply curve is  graphic illustration of the relationship between price   shown on the vertical axis   and quantity   shown on the horizontal axis  	1
 the supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information  	0
 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree   that is   where the amount of the product consumers want to buy   quantity demanded   is equal to the amount producers want to sell   quantity supplied    	1
 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree   that is   where the amount of the product consumers want to buy   quantity demanded   is equal to the amount producers want to sell   quantity supplied    	1
 this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity  	0
 at any other price   the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied   so the market is not in equilibrium at that price  	0
 the previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied  	0
 the result was the demand curve and the supply curve  	0
 for some   luxury cars   vacations in europe   and fine jewelry   the effect of  rise in income can be especially pronounced  	0
  product whose demand rises when income rises   and vice versa   is called  normal good  	1
  few exceptions to this pattern do exist  	0
 the demand for  product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements  	0
  substitute is  good or service that can be used in place of another good or service  	1
 as electronic books   like this one   become more available   you would expect to see  decrease in demand for traditional printed books  	0
 if other factors relevant to supply do change   then the entire supply curve will shift  	0
 just as  shift in demand is represented by  change in the quantity demanded at every price    shift in supply means  change in the quantity supplied at every price  	0
 according to the pew research center for people and the press   more and more people   especially younger people   are getting their news from online and digital sources  	0
 the majority of us adults now own smartphones or tablets   and most of those americans say they use them in part to get the news  	0
 laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called price controls  	1
 price controls come in two flavors  	0
 markets for labor have demand and supply curves   just like markets for goods  	0
 the law of demand applies in labor markets this way    higher salary or wage   that is    higher price in the labor market   leads to  decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers   while  lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded  	0
 the law of supply functions in labor markets   too    higher price for labor leads to  higher quantity of labor supplied    lower price leads to  lower quantity supplied  	0
 equilibrium in the labor market	0
 the demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate   under the ceteris paribus assumption  	1
  change in the wage or salary will result in  change in the quantity demanded of labor  	0
 some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit  	0
 some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses  	0
 in this section   we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital      savings   with those who demand financial capital      borrowing    	0
 those who save money   or make financial investments   which is the same thing     whether individuals or businesses   are on the supply side of the financial market  	0
 participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods   now or in the future  	1
 economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time  	0
 unlike  decision about what to buy from the grocery store   decisions about investment or saving are made across  period of time   sometimes  long period  	0
  change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets  	0
 the vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive  	0
 price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices  	1
 if jos  had unlimited income or goods were free   then he could consume without limit  	0

 the fourth    shirt is just to something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only <num> additional utils  	0
 this is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility   which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added  	1
 the general rule can also be expressed as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities  	0
 when the price of good <num> is divided by the price of good <num>   at the utility   maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good <num> divided by the marginal utility of good <num>  	1
 this rule   known as the consumer equilibrium   can be written in algebraic form  	0
 conversely   when income falls   the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods  	0
 as defined in the chapter on demand and supply and again in the chapter on elasticity   goods and services are called normal goods when  rise in income leads to  rise in the quantity consumed of that good and  fall in income leads to  fall in quantity consumed  	1
 however   depending on kimberly   preferences    rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines  	0
  choice like  means that  rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline   while  choice like  would mean that  rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline  	0
 the substitution effect occurs when  price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with  relatively higher price and more of the good with  relatively lower price  	1
 the income effect is that  higher price means   in effect   the buying power of income has been reduced   even though actual income has not changed     which leads to buying less of the good   when the good is normal    	1
 in this example   the higher price for baseball bats would cause sergei to buy  fewer bats for both reasons  	0
 the middle   close   to   vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of  person who reacts to  higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor  	0
 the very top portion of the labor supply curve is called  backward   bending supply curve for labor   which is the situation of high   wage people who can earn so much that they respond to  still   higher wage by working fewer hours  	1

 yelberton will compare the different choices along the budget constraint and choose the one that provides him with the highest utility  	0
 for example   he will compare the utility he would receive from  choice like point    with consumption of   <num> million in the present   zero savings   and zero future consumption   point    with present consumption of   <num> <num>   savings of   <num> <num>   and future consumption of   <num> <num> <num>   point    with present consumption of   <num> <num>   savings of   <num> <num>   and future consumption of   <num> <num> <num>   or even choice    with present consumption of zero   savings of   <num> <num> <num>   and future consumption of   <num> <num> <num>  	0
 we tend to focus more on the loss than the gain  	1
 this is known as loss aversion   where    <num> loss pains us <num> times more than    <num> gain helps us   according to the economists daniel kahneman and amos tversky in  famous <num> article in the journal econometrica  	0
 this insight has implications for investing   as people tend to   overplay   the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains  	0
 firms are said to be in perfect competition when the following conditions occur     <num>   many firms produce identical products     <num>   many buyers are available to buy the product   and many sellers are available to sell the product     <num>   sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold   and   <num>   firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions   in other words   there is free entry and exit into and out of the market  	1
 total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm   broken down into fixed and variable costs   are shown in <link> and also appear in <link>  	0
 the horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs   the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs   measured in dollars  	0
 new firms may start production   as well  	0
 when new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry  	1
 losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee  	0
 if  business is making losses in the short run   it will either keep limping along or just shut down   depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs  	0
 entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind  process that   in the long run   pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning  zero profit to understand how short   run profits for  perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run   imagine the following situation  	0
 the market is in long   run equilibrium   where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where    mr   mc and    ac  	0
 no firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market  	0
 for  decreasing cost industry   as the market expands   the old and new firms experience lower costs of production   which makes the new zero   profit level intersect at  lower price than before  	1
 in this case   the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs  	0
 in this chapter   we explore the opposite extreme   monopoly if perfect competition is  market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price   monopoly is  market with no competition at all   and firms have complete market power  	0
 in the case of monopoly   one firm produces all of the output in  market  	1
 since  monopoly faces no significant competition   it can charge any price it wishes  	0
 one is natural monopoly   where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition  	1
 the other is legal monopoly   where laws prohibit   or severely limit   competition  	1
  trademark is an identifying symbol or name for  particular good   like chiquita bananas   chevrolet cars   or the nike   swoosh   that appears on shoes and athletic gear  	1
 roughly <num> million trademarks are registered with the us government  	0
 taken together   this combination of patents   trademarks   copyrights   and trade secret law is called intellectual property   because it implies ownership over an idea   concept   or image   not  physical piece of property like  house or  car  	1
 countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property   although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries  	0
 profits for the monopolist   like any firm   will be equal to total revenues minus total costs  	0
 the pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of  perfectly competitive firm   that is   by using total cost   fixed cost   variable cost   marginal cost   average cost   and average variable cost  	0
 however   because  monopoly faces no competition   its situation and its decision process will differ from that of  perfectly competitive firm  	0
 <link> repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from <link>   and adds two more columns   marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold  	1
 it is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost  	0
 what about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes   firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive  	0
 what determines their behavior  	0
 monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other   but selling products that are distinctive in some way  	1
 examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing   restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food   and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names  	0
  monopolistically competitive firm perceives  demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition  	1
 <link> offers  reminder that the demand curve as faced by  perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic or flat   because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market price  	0
 in contrast   the demand curve   as faced by  monopolist   is the market demand curve   since  monopolist is the only firm in the market   and hence is downward sloping  	0
 as long as the firm is earning positive economic profits   new competitors will continue to enter the market   reducing the original firm   demand and marginal revenue curves  	0
 the long   run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point    where the firm   perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve  	0
 the long   term result of entry and exit in  perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve  	0
 this outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency   goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost  	0
 however   in monopolistic competition   the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with  price that lies on the downward   sloping portion of the average cost curve   not at the very bottom of the ac curve  	0
 similarly    natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in  market is only large enough for  single firm to operate at the minimum of the long   run average cost curve  	0
 in such  setting   the market has room for only one firm   because no smaller firm can operate at  low enough average cost to compete   and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market  	0
 when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high   it is called collusion  	1
  group of firms that have  formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called  cartel  	1
 see the following clear it up feature for  more in   depth analysis of the difference between the two  	0
 because of the complexity of oligopoly   which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms   there is no single   generally   accepted theory of how oligopolies behave   in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures  	1
 instead   economists use game theory    branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do  	1
 game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences   as well as in business   law   and military strategy  	0
 the result of this prisoner   dilemma is often that even though  and  could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing  lower level of output and acting like  monopolist   the two firms may well end up in  situation where they each increase output and earn only   <num> each in profits  	0
 the following clear it up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular  	0
 if one firm cuts its price to   <num>   it will be able to sell only <num> <num> seats  	0
 however   if the airline seeks to raise prices   the other oligopolists will not raise their prices   and so the firm that raised prices will lose  considerable share of sales  	0
  corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become  single firm  	1
 when one firm purchases another   it is called an acquisition  	1
 an acquisition may not look just like  merger   since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name  	0

 also in <num>   the federal trade commission   ftc   was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair  	0
 an early tool was the concentration ratio   which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms   typically the top four to eight firms  	1
 for an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy   refer to monopoly say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in  certain city has <num> firms with the market shares shown in <link>   where the market share is each firm   proportion of total sales in that market  	0
 the four   firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms   in this case   <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>  	0
 however   in the total market for all computer software and services   including everything from games to scientific programs   the microsoft share was only about <num>   in <num>  	0
  narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher   while  broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller there are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades   one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization  	1
 in addition   these two shifts are interconnected  	0
 antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices   practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced   but that might have the effect of reducing competition  	1
 antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial   because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others  	0
 for example   if  product manufacturer is selling to  group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand  minimum resale price maintenance agreement   which would require the dealers to sell for at least  certain minimum price  	1
  minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers  	0
 even if  customer was interested in  portable tv   the tying to  particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market  	0
  related   but not identical   concept is called bundling   where two or more products are sold as one  	1
 bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for  better price  	0
  natural monopoly poses  difficult challenge for competition policy   because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly  	0
  natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand  	1
 this typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs  	0
 they calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies   added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn   and set the price for consumers accordingly  	1
 this method was known as cost   plus regulation  	0
 one difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture   in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing  large role in setting the regulations that they will follow  	1
 when the airline industry was being regulated   for example   it suggested appointees to the regulatory board   sent lobbyists to argue with the board   provided most of the information on which the board made decisions   and offered well   paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board  	0
 private markets   such as the cell phone industry   offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced   how they are produced   and who gets them  	0
 the principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is  fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking  	0
 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved   they are sometimes called spillovers  	1
 externalities can be negative or positive  	0

 now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution   that is   the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make  refrigerator   but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution  	0
 if the firm is required to pay   <num> for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces  refrigerator   production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by   <num>  	0
 other laws required the installation of certain equipment   for example   on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks   to reduce pollution  	0
 these types of laws   which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution   control technologies must be used   fall under the category of command   and   control regulation  	0
 in effect   command   and   control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti   pollution equipment   firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account  	1
 command   and   control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the us environment  	0
  pollution charge is  tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that  firm emits  	1
  pollution charge gives  profit   maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions   as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax  	0

 the tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with  production possibility frontier   ppf   such as the one shown in <link>  	1
 at one extreme   at  choice like     country would be selecting  high level of economic output but very little environmental protection  	0
 depending on their different income levels and political preferences   countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency   that is   the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier  	1
 however   all countries should prefer to make  choice that shows productive efficiency   that is   the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it  	1

 will private firms in  market economy under invest in research and technology  	0
 if  firm builds  factory or buys  piece of equipment   the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments  	0
 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product   whether enjoyed by other companies or society as  whole   as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology  	1
 as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities   positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to  third party   or parties consider the example of the big drug company   which is planning its   budget for the next year  	1
 economists and scientists working for big drug have compiled  list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return  	0
 after all   if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education   society should expect some kind of return on that spending  	0
 again   economists like george psacharopoulos have found that   across  variety of nations   the social rate of return on schooling is also positive  	0
 after all   positive externalities exist from investment in education  	0
 intellectual property rights include patents   which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make   use   or sell the invention for  limited time   and copyright laws   which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature   music   film   video   and pictures  	1
 for example   if  pharmaceutical firm has  patent on  new drug   then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty   one years   unless the firm with the patent grants permission  	0
 without  patent   the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products   and could earn no more than  normal rate of profit  	0

 economists like tyler cowen    professor at george mason university   are seeing more and more evidence of  widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology   and those who do not  	0
 according to cowen author of the recent book   average is over   powering america beyond the age of the great stagnation   this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills   and ultimately   in wages and global standards of living  	0
 poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below  certain level of income   called the poverty line   that defines the income needed for  basic standard of living  	1
 income inequality compares the share of the total income   or wealth   in society that is received by different groups   for example   comparing the share of income received by the top <num>   to the share of income received by the bottom <num>    	1
 after all   according to the federal register   the median household income for  family of four was   <num> <num> in new jersey and   <num> <num> in mississippi in <num>   and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states  	0
 the poverty line is based on cash income   which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in  non   cash form   like medicaid   health care for low   income individuals and families   and food aid  	1
 also   low   income families can qualify for federal housing assistance  	0

 this labor market situation resembles what  monopoly firm does in selling  product   but in this case  union is  monopoly selling labor to firms  	0
 at the higher union wage wu   the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium  	0
 because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries   the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were  	0
 it is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers   including the american federation of state   county and municipal employees   afscme     the service employees international union   and the national education association  	1

 many economic transactions are made in  situation of imperfect information   where either the buyer   the seller   or both   are less than <num>   certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold  	1
 also   the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information   in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction  	1
  market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as  thin market  	1
 by contrast    market with many buyers and sellers is called  thick market  	1
 sellers may offer  warranty   which is  promise to fix or replace the good   at least for  certain period of time  	1
 the seller may also offer  buyer  chance to buy  service contract   where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for  set time period  	1
 another approach is to require  cosigner on  loan   that is   another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so  	1
 yet another approach is to require collateral   often property or equipment that the bank would have  right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid  	1
 federal and state governments run  number of insurance programs  	0
 some of the programs look much like private insurance   in the sense that the members of  group makes steady payments into  fund   and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments  	0

 health insurance policies often have  copayment   in which the policyholder must pay  small amount   for example    person might have to pay   <num> for each doctor visit   and the insurance company would cover the rest  	1
 another method of cost   sharing is coinsurance   which means that the insurance company covers  certain percentage of the cost  	1
 however   in the last decade or so   the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations   hmos    	0
  health maintenance organization   hmo   provides healthcare that receives  fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan   regardless of how many services are provided  	1
 in this case    patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care   but the healthcare provider   which is receiving only  fixed payment   has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided   as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later  	0

  bond is basically an    owe you   note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital   money    	0
 the bond has  face value  	0
 this is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity  	1
 the bond has  maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment  	1
 combining the bond   face value   interest rate   and maturity date   and market interest rates   allows  buyer to compute  bond   present value   which is the most that  buyer would be willing to pay for  given bond  	1

  rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make  difference  	1
 this theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high   or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election  	1
 in  <num> work   an economic theory of democracy   the economist anthony downs stated the problem this way     it seems probable that for  great many citizens in  democracy   rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se  	0
 no matter how significant  difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information   or how uncertain he is about which party to support   he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome   he will not even utilize all the free information available   since assimilating it takes time  	0

 how large is the us economy  	0
 the size of  nation   overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product   gdp     which is the value of all final goods and services produced within  country in  given year  	1
 the measurement of gdp involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services   smart phones   cars   music downloads   computers   steel   bananas   college educations   and all other new goods and services produced in the current year   and summing them into  total dollar value  	0
 if starbucks builds  new store   or amazon buys robots   these expenditures are counted under business investment  	0
 investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand   typically accounting for only about <num> <num>   of gdp   but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created  	0
 however   it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption  	0
 since the early <num>   imports have typically exceeded exports   and so the united states has experienced  trade deficit in most years  	0
 indeed   the trade deficit grew quite large in the late <num> and in the mid <num>  	0
 they are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of  year  	0
 statisticians who calculate gdp must avoid the mistake of double counting   in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production  	1
 for example   imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by  tire manufacturer   and then counted the value of  new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires  	0
 one of the closest cousins of gdp is the gross national product   gnp    	0
 gdp includes only what is produced within  country   borders  	0
 gdp deflator is  price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy  	1
 we explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in inflation   but this definition will do in the context of this chapter  	0
 the generally upward long   term path of gdp has been regularly interrupted by short   term declines  	0
  significant decline in real gdp is called  recession  	1
 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called  depression  	1
 <link> lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the us economy since <num>  	0
 the highest point of the economy   before the recession begins   is called the peak   conversely   the lowest point of  recession   before  recovery begins   is called the trough  	1
 thus    recession lasts from peak to trough   and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak  	0
 to compare the gdp of countries with different currencies   it is necessary to convert to    common denominator   using an exchange rate   which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency  	1
 exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country    currency that need to be traded for  single unit of country    currency   for example   japanese yen per british pound     or as the inverse   for example   british pounds per japanese yen    	0

  microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of  firm   or perhaps an industry  	1
 in macroeconomics   the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function  	1
 the category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads   also called infrastructure    	1
 again   greater physical capital implies more output  	0
 to obtain  per capita production function   divide each input in <link>      by the population  	0
 this creates  second aggregate production function where the output is gdp per capita   that is   gdp divided by population    	1

 the economist alexander gerschenkron   <num>   <num>   gave this phenomenon  memorable name     the advantages of backwardness  	0
 of course   he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have  lower standard of living  	0
 he was pointing out that  country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up  	0
 it also includes those who do want  job but have quit looking   often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment  	0
 economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force  	0
 another important statistic is the labor force participation rate  	0
 this is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for  job  	1
 one reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the us bureau of the census  	0
 but  more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low   income countries   most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly  	0
 instead   workers in these countries are engaged in short   term work   subsistence activities   and barter  	0
 from the standpoint of the supply   and   demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets   unemployment represents something of  puzzle  	0
 in  supply   and   demand model of  labor market   as illustrated in <link>   the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity  	1
 at the equilibrium wage   we     the equilibrium quantity   qe   of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers  	0
 at the equilibrium wage   we     the equilibrium quantity   qe   of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers  	1
 economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy   not just  few  	0
  number of different theories have been proposed   but they share  common tone  	0
 the adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers   then the best workers   those with the best employment alternatives at other firms   are the most likely to leave  	1
 the least attractive workers   with fewer employment alternatives   are more likely to stay  	0
 why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies   through good economic years and bad  	0
 economists have  term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy   it is called the natural rate of unemployment  	1
 another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment  	0
 the structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market   either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have   or because they never learned any skills  	1
 moreover   the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services   but wages and income levels   too  	0

 find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods  	0
 the general equation for percentage changes between two years   whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation   is  	0
 the most commonly cited measure of inflation in the united states is the consumer price index   cpi    	0
 the cpi is calculated by government statisticians at the us bureau of labor statistics based on the prices in  fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four  	1
 if the new good is not included in the cpi for some years   until its price is already lower   the cpi may miss counting this price decline altogether  	0
 taking these arguments together   the quality   new goods bias means that the rise in the price of  fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in  consumer   true cost of living   because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living  	1
 the following clear it up feature is  must   read on how the cpi is comprised and calculated  	0
 it can be broken down into price indices for different industries   commodities   and stages of processing   like finished goods   intermediate goods   crude materials for further processing   and so on    	0
 there is an international price index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported  	0

 the first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms   they are right after world war  and world war ii  	0
 however   there are also two periods of severe negative inflation   called deflation   in the early decades of the twentieth century   one following the deep recession of <num> <num> and the other during the great depression of the <num>  	1
   since inflation is  time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced   deflation will be  time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases  	0
 economists usually oppose high inflation   but they oppose it in  milder way than many non   economists  	0
 robert shiller   one of <num>   nobel prize winners in economics   carried out several surveys during the <num> about attitudes toward inflation  	0
 one of his questions asked     do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority   as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools    	0
 answers were on  scale of <num> <num>   where <num> meant   fully agree   and <num> meant   completely disagree   for the us population as  whole   <num>   answered   fully agree   that preventing high inflation was  highly important national priority and just <num>   said   completely disagree   however   among professional economists   only <num>   answered   fully agree     while the same percentage of <num>   answered   completely disagree  	0
 the land of funny money	0
 if all prices   wages   and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation   as in the land of funny money   then no one   purchasing power   profits   or real loan payments would change  	0
 however   if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation   or if they adjust for inflation only after  time lag   then inflation can cause three types of problems   unintended redistributions of purchasing power   blurred price signals   and difficulties in long   term planning  	0
 one sizable group of people has often received  large share of their income in  form that does not increase over time   retirees who receive  private company pension  	0
 most pensions have traditionally been set as  fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement  	1
 for this reason   pensions are called   defined benefits   plans  	0
 high and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker  	1
 markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly   and many individual markets will experience  greater chance of surpluses and shortages  	0
 when  price   wage   or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation   it is said to be indexed  	1
 an indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation  	1
 loans often have built   in inflation adjustments   too   so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points   then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well  	0
 an adjustable   rate mortgage   arm   is  kind of loan used to purchase  home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation  	1
 often    borrower will be able receive  lower interest rate if borrowing with an arm   compared to  fixed   rate loan  	0
 the balance of trade   or trade balance   is any gap between  nation   dollar value of its exports   or what its producers sell abroad   and  nation   dollar worth of imports   or the foreign   made products and services that households and businesses purchase  	1
 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports   the economy is said to have  trade surplus  	0
 at some point   foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries  	0
 the economy then drops into deep recession   with real gdp often falling up to <num>   or more in  single year  	0
 this happened to mexico in <num> when their gdp fell <num>    	0
 do not confuse the balance of trade   which tracks imports and exports     with the current account balance   which includes not just exports and imports   but also income from investment and transfers  	0
 although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods   the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades  	0
 for example   us exports of services were equal to about one   half of us exports of goods in <num>   compared to one   fifth in <num> the third component of the current account balance   labeled   income payments     refers to money received by us financial investors on their foreign investments   money flowing into the united states   and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here   money flowing out of the united states    	1
 the reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade   along with goods and services   is that   from an economic perspective   income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil   it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market  	0
 as economists see it   trade surpluses can be either good or bad   depending on circumstances   and trade deficits can be good or bad   too  	0
 the challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital  	0
 in this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways    parable of trade between robinson crusoe and friday   and  circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments  	0
 investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country  	0
 similarly   we see on the bottom third line   an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income   bottom fourth line   flowing from the home country to the rest of the world  	0
 the investment income   bottom lines two and four   are found in the current account   while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country   lines one and three   are found in the financial account  	0
 the fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true  	0
 domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital  	0
 when japan   economy was growing vigorously in the <num> and <num>   its large trade surpluses were often described   especially by non   economists   as either  cause or  result of its robust economic health  	0
 but from  standpoint of economic growth   japan   economy has been teetering in and out of recession since <num>   with real gdp growth averaging only about <num>   per year   and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher  	0
 clearly    whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health  	0
 how is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate  	0
 is there  reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions   lower unemployment and higher inflation from <num> to <num>   higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early <num>   lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid <num>   and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in <num>  	0
 why did the current account deficit rise so high   but then decline in <num>  	0
 those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of  famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named jean   baptiste say   <num>   <num>    	0
 say   law is     supply creates its own demand   as  matter of historical accuracy   it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs   but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing  point of view the intuition behind say   law is that each time  good or service is produced and sold   it generates income that is earned for someone    worker    manager   an owner   or those who are workers   managers   and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production  	1
 the forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall  	0
 nevertheless    recession is not  situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes  	0
  recession is  situation in which the economy as  whole is shrinking in size   business failures outnumber the remaining success stories   and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers  	1
 say   law that supply creates its own demand does seem  good approximation for the long run  	0
 profits   in turn   are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs   like labor or raw materials   the firm needs to buy  	0
 aggregate supply   as   refers to the total quantity of output    	1
 real gdp   firms will produce and sell  	1
 when an economy is operating at its potential gdp   machines and factories are running at capacity   and the unemployment rate is relatively low   at the natural rate of unemployment  	0
 for this reason   potential gdp is sometimes also called full   employment gdp  	0
 the foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the united states while remaining fixed in other countries   then goods in the united states will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world  	0
 us exports will be relatively more expensive   and the quantity of exports sold will fall  	0
 us imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper   so the quantity of imports will rise  	0
 for this reason   what we have been calling the as curve   will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply   sras   curve  	0
 the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply   lras   curve  	0
 for example   the us economy experienced recessions in <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>   <num>   and <num>   <num> that were each preceded or accompanied by  rise in the key input of oil prices  	0
 in the <num>   this pattern of  shift to the left in sras leading to  stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation  	0
 conversely    decline in the price of  key input like oil will shift the sras curve to the right   providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs  	0
 from <num> to <num>   for example   the average price of crude oil fell by almost half   from   <num>  barrel to   <num>  barrel  	0
 if changes of  few percentage points of gdp seem small to you   remember that since gdp was about   <num> trillion in <num>    seemingly small change of <num>   of gdp is equal to close to   <num> billion tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending   too  	0
 tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand   while tax increases will tend to diminish it  	0
 tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment  	0
 two types of unemployment were described in the unemployment chapter  	0
 cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short   run movements of gdp  	1
 over the long run   in the united states   the unemployment rate typically hovers around <num>     give or take one percentage point or so     when the economy is healthy  	0
 focus first on the keynesian zone   that portion of the sras curve on the far left which is relatively flat  	1
 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like ek   then certain statements about the economic situation will follow  	0
 the idea is simple   firms produce output only if they expect it to sell  	0
 thus   while the availability of the factors of production determines  nation   potential gdp   the amount of goods and services actually being sold   known as real gdp   depends on how much demand exists across the economy  	1
 this point is illustrated in <link>  	0
 the keynesian ad   as modelthe keynesian view of the ad   as model uses an sras curve   which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output  	0
 as  consequence   the economy experiences inflation  	0
 the key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap   increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output recall from the aggregate supply   aggregate demand model that aggregate demand is total spending   economy   wide   on domestic goods and services  	1
   aggregate demand   ad   is actually what economists call total planned expenditure  	0
 spending on new capital goods is called investment expenditure  	1
 investment falls into four categories   producer   durable equipment and software   new nonresidential structures   such as factories   offices   and retail locations     changes in inventories   and residential structures   such as single   family homes   townhouses   and apartment buildings    	0
   keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering  policy prescription for minimizing their effects  	1
 the keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks  	0
 first   aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment  	0
 second   frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry   especially if they find out that  product now costs more than expected  	1
 these costs of changing prices are called menu costs   like the costs of printing up  new set of menus with different prices in  restaurant  	0
 prices do respond to forces of supply and demand   but from  macroeconomic perspective   the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time  	0
 thus   when investment spending collapsed during the great depression   it caused  much larger decrease in real gdp  	0
 the size of the multiplier is critical and was  key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the obama administration   fiscal stimulus package   officially titled the american recovery and reinvestment act of <num>  	0
 many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation  	0
 this pattern became known as stagflation  	0
   recall from the aggregate demand   aggregate supply model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation  	1
 he proposed that the government could bury money underground   and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again  	0
 these suggestions were slightly tongue   in   cheek   but their purpose was to emphasize that  great depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential gdp  	0
 the neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that   in the long run   the economy will fluctuate around its potential gdp and its natural rate of unemployment  	0
 this chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics     <num>   the size of the economy is determined by potential gdp   and   <num>   wages and prices will adjust in  flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential gdp level of output  	0
 actual or real gdp is benchmarked against the potential gdp to determine how well the economy is performing  	0
 growth in gdp can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology  	0
 neoclassical economists who focus on potential gdp as the primary determinant of real gdp argue that the long   run aggregate supply curve is located at potential gdp   that is   the long   run aggregate supply curve is  vertical line drawn at the level of potential gdp   as shown in <link>  	0
  vertical lras curve means that the level of aggregate supply   or potential gdp   will determine the real gdp of the economy   regardless of the level of aggregate demand  	0
 over time   increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital   increases in human capital   and technological advancements shift potential gdp and the vertical lras curve gradually to the right  	0
 after all   many people and firms are not especially well informed   either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works  	0
 an alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations   they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change   but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory  	1
 if most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations   then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time the empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear   cut  	0
 the keynesian perspective introduced the phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve  	0
 the short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies  downward sloping phillips curve   thus   there is  tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run  	0
 neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as  useful tool for reducing unemployment   after all   if economic output is determined by  vertical aggregate supply curve   then aggregate demand has no long   run effect on unemployment  	0
 instead   neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right   keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low  	0
 however   the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of  few years  	0
 nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long   lasting recession   like the great depression of the <num>  	0
 keynesian economics tends to view inflation as  price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment   neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as  cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment  	0
 at this point   you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from welcome to economics  	0
   economic growth   low unemployment   and low inflation  	0
 we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals  	0
 you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand   aggregate supply   ad   as   model  	0
 with the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind   the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy   monetary policy   which focuses on money   banking and interest rates   and fiscal policy   which focuses on government spending   taxes   and borrowing  	1
   we will get to its definition soon  	0
 first   money serves as  medium of exchange   which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller  	0
 instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes   the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money  	0
 finally   another function of money is that money must serve as  standard of deferred payment  	0
 this means that if money is usable today to make purchases   it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future  	1
 of course   gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry  	0
 as commodity money   gold has historically served its purpose as  medium of exchange    store of value   and as  unit of account  	0
 commodity   backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at  bank  	1
 during much of its history   the money supply in the united states was backed by gold and silver  	0
	0
 less liquid  	0
 the federal reserve bank   which is the central bank of the united states   is  bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity  	1
 there are two definitions of money   <chem> and <chem> money supply  	0
  broader definition of money   <chem> includes everything in <chem> but also adds other types of deposits  	0
 for example   <chem> includes savings deposits in banks   which are bank accounts on which you can not write  check directly   but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank  	1
 many banks and other financial institutions also offer  chance to invest in money market funds   where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in  safe way   such as short   term government bonds  	0
 where does   plastic money   like debit cards   credit cards   and smart money fit into this picture  	0
  debit card   like  check   is an instruction to the user   bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller  	1
 it is important to note that in our definition of money   it ischeckable deposits that are money   not the paper check or the debit card  	0
 one key message underlying this discussion of <chem> and <chem> is that money in  modern economy is not just paper bills and coins   instead   money is closely linked to bank accounts  	0
 indeed   the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the banking system  	0
 the next section explains how banks function and how  nation   banking system has the power to create money  	0
 banks as financial intermediariesan   intermediary   is one who stands between two other parties  	1
 banks are  financial intermediary   that is   an institution that operates between  saver who deposits money in  bank and  borrower who receives  loan from that bank  	1
 financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds   but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions   which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans  	0
  bank   balance sheeta balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities  	1
 an asset is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something  	1
 in this case    home is the asset   but the mortgage is the liability  	0
 the net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed   the liability    	1
 the net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed   the liability    	1
  bank   balance sheet operates in much the same way  	0
 many banks issue home loans   and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so   but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments  	0
 the market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market   while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market  	1
 one key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for  loan   when they buy it in the secondary loan market   is the perceived riskiness of the loan   that is   given the characteristics of the borrower   such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly   what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid  	1
 the greater the risk that  loan will not be repaid   the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan  	0
 securitization offers certain advantages  	0
 if  bank makes most of its loans in  local area   then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines   so that many people are unable to make their payments  	0
 clearly   the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers  	0
 how can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset   liability time mismatch  	0
 one strategy is for  bank to diversify its loans   which means lending to  variety of customers  	1
 for example   suppose  bank specialized in lending to  niche market   say   making  high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area  	0
 the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that  nation   financial system operates smoothly is called the central bank  	1
 most nations have central banks or currency boards  	0
  safe and stable national financial system is  critical concern of the federal reserve  	0
 the goal is not only to protect individuals   savings   but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself  	0
 banks are allowed to make loans to businesses   individuals   and other banks  	0
 they are allowed to purchase us treasury securities but   to protect depositors   they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky  	0
 bank capital is the difference between  bank   assets and its liabilities  	1
 in other words   it is  bank   net worth  	0
 the practical question is that measuring the value of  bank   assets is not always straightforward  	0
 as discussed in money and banking    bank   assets are its loans   and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid  	1
 these issues can become even more complex when  bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries   or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than  basic loan  	0
 the political question arises because the decision by  bank supervisor to require  bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial   and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off  	0
 about <num> countries around the world   including all of the major economies   have deposit insurance programs  	0
 in the united states   the federal deposit insurance corporation   fdic   is responsible for deposit insurance  	1
 banks pay an insurance premium to the fdic  	0
 the most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the us is open market operations  	0
 open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys us treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates  	1
  second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement   which   as we noted earlier   is the percentage of each bank   deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank  	1
 if banks are required to hold  greater amount in reserves   they have less money available to lend out  	0
  monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy  	1
 conversely    monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is  contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy  	1
 of course   financial markets display  wide range of interest rates   representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time  	0
 in general   when the federal funds rate drops substantially   other interest rates drop   too   and when the federal funds rate rises   other interest rates rise  	0
 in <link>        the original equilibrium   <chem>   occurs at an output of <num>   which is above potential gdp  	0
  contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates   discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending   and cause the original demand curve   <chem>   to shift left to <chem>   so that the new equilibrium   <chem>   occurs at the potential gdp level of <num> these examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical   that is   it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings  	1
 monetary policy should be loosened when  recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens  	0
 with the recession still ongoing   the fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing   qe    	0
 this is the purchase of long   term government and private mortgage   backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand  	1
 banks are legally required to hold  minimum level of reserves   but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit  	0
 for example   during  recession banks may be hesitant to lend   because they fear that when the economy is contracting    high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans  	0
 unpredictable movements of velocityvelocity is  term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy  	1
 the velocity of money in  year is defined as  	0
 remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation  	1
 if the nominal interest rate is <num>   and the rate of inflation is <num>     then the borrower is effectively paying  <num>   real interest rate  	0
 if the nominal interest rate is <num>   and there is deflation of <num>     then the real interest rate is actually <num>    	0
 so far at least   it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up   and   down fluctuations in <chem>  	0
 given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking   <chem> is now favored as  measure of money rather than the narrower <chem>  	0
 in the neoclassical model   the level of potential gdp   and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential gdp   is determined by real economic factors  	0
 if the original level of aggregate demand is <chem>   then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to <chem> only creates an inflationary increase in the price level   but it does not alter gdp or unemployment  	0
 from this perspective   all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation   and low inflation provides  better climate for  healthy and growing economy  	0
 instead   the law governing the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account  	0
 economists have no final consensus on whether  central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion  	0
 for those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy   the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct  loose monetary policy   even if the economy is already producing at potential gdp  	0
 in some countries   the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures   with the result of higher inflation   but no long   term reduction in unemployment  	0
 at  broader level   some economists worry about  leverage cycle   where   leverage   is  term used by financial economists to mean   borrowing  	1
 when economic times are good   banks and the financial sector are eager to lend   and people and firms are eager to borrow  	0
 remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by  money multiplier    process of loans being made   money being deposited   and more loans being made  	1
 this chapter discusses the international dimension of money   which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate  	0
 an exchange rate is nothing more than  price   that is   the price of one currency in terms of another currency   and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand  	1
 the first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets   their size   their main participants   and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates  	0
 you have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters  	0
 in the international trade and capital flows   for example   we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare gdp statistics from countries where gdp is measured in different currencies  	0
 these earlier examples   however   took the actual exchange rate as given   as if it were  fact of nature  	0
 the other kind of international financial investment   portfolio investment   involves  purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility  	1
 an example would be  us financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the united kingdom   or deposited money in  british bank  	0
 these banks   and  few other firms     known as dealers   then trade the foreign exchange  	0
 this is called the interbank market  	0
 the horizontal axis shows the quantity of mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market  	0
 the demand curve      for mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve      of mexican pesos at the equilibrium point        which is an exchange rate of <num> cents in us currency for each mexican peso and  total volume of <num> billion pesos  	0
 note that the two exchange rates are inverses   <num> pesos per dollar is the same as <num> cents per peso   or   <num> per peso    	0
 if the price of cars was much higher than   <num> <num> in this example   then at least some canadian buyers would convert their canadian dollars to us dollars and go to the united states to purchase their cars  	0
 this is known as arbitrage   the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at  profit  	1
 it may occur slowly   but over time   it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries  	0
  central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons     <num>   movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy     <num>   frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in  nation   banking system   this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital   which can set the economy up for  deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country  	0
 let   discuss these scenarios in turn  	0
 exchange rates   aggregate demand   and aggregate supply	0
 in <num>   <num>   countries across eastern asia   like thailand   korea   malaysia   and indonesia   experienced  sharp depreciation of their currencies   in some cases <num>   or more  	0
 these countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of foreign investment capital   with bank lending increasing by <num>   to <num>   per year through the mid  <num>  	0
 when their exchange rates depreciated   the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt  	0
  policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as  floating exchange rate  	1
 the us dollar is  floating exchange rate   as are the currencies of about <num>   of the countries in the world economy  	0
 when  government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced   it is said to have established    peg   for its currency  	1
  soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market   but in some cases   especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction   the central bank will intervene in the market  	1
 with  hard peg exchange rate policy   the central bank sets  fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate  	1
 the central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals   use the reals to purchase foreign currencies   and avoid selling any of its own currency  	0
 in this way   it can fill the gap between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its currency  	0
 for example   when  country pegs its exchange rate   it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession   but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg  	0
 with  soft peg exchange rate policy   the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession   but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate  	0
 with  hard peg policy   domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment   but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg  	0
 thus   even though the goal of  soft peg policy is to reduce short   term fluctuations of the exchange rate   the existence of the policy   when anticipated in the foreign exchange market   may sometimes increase short   term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act  	0
 the following clear it up feature discusses the effects of international capital flows   capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment  	0
 but proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties  	0
 taxes are imposed by national governments   not international ones  	0
 in this chapter   we revisit fiscal policy   which was first covered in welcome to economics  	0
 fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy   the other is monetary policy    	0
 while monetary policy is made by policymakers at the federal reserve   fiscal policy is made by congress and the president the discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand  	0
 when the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in  given year   it runs  budget deficit  	1
 conversely   when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in  year   it runs  budget surplus  	1
 if government spending and taxes are equal   it is said to have  balanced budget  	1
 when most people think of taxes levied by the federal government   the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on april <num>   or the first business day after    	0
 the personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue   but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue  	0
 the second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax   captured in social insurance and retirement receipts     which provides funds for social security and medicare  	0
 payroll taxes have increased steadily over time  	0
 the medicare payroll tax is also called  proportional tax   that is    flat percentage of all wages earned  	1
 the social security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit   but above that level it becomes  regressive tax   meaning that people with higher incomes pay  smaller share of their income in tax  	1
 the federal government has  few other   smaller sources of revenue  	0
 it imposes an excise tax   that is    tax on  particular good   on gasoline   tobacco   and alcohol  	1
 as  share of gdp   the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time   from about <num>   of gdp in the <num> to roughly <num>   by <num>   according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office  	0
 another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits  	0
 the national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time   in contrast   the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year  	1
 <link> shows the ratio of debt   gdp since <num>  	0
 the millions of unemployed in <num>   <num> could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries  	0
 federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy   when the government passes  new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels  	1
 the stimulus package of <num> is an example  	0
 in the early <num>   many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle   and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation   were  thing of the past  	0
 on the cover of its december <num>   <num>   issue   time magazine   then the premier news magazine in the united states   ran  picture of john maynard keynes   and the story inside identified keynesian theories as   the prime influence on the world   economies  	0
 the article reported that policymakers have   used keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent   business   cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices  	0
 this happy consensus   however   did not last  	0
 the us economy suffered one recession from december <num> to november <num>    deeper recession from november <num> to march <num>   and then double   dip recessions from january to june <num> and from july <num> to november <num>  	0
 it often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that  downturn has started   and  few months more to confirm that it is truly  recession and not just  one  or two   month blip  	0
 the time it takes to determine that  recession has occurred is often called the recognition lag  	1
 after this lag   policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills  	0
 most economists view the proposals for  perpetually balanced budget with bemusement  	0
 after all   in the short term   economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers  	0
 the national saving and investment identity   first introduced in the international trade and capital flows chapter   provides  framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets  	0
 the identity begins with  statement that must always hold true   the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded  	0
 the us economy has two main sources for financial capital   private savings from inside the us economy and public savings  	0
 total savings   private savings        public savings        	1
 total savings   private savings        public savings        	0
 these include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad  	0
 if private saving and the trade balance remain the same   then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital  	0
 when government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital   the result is known as crowding out  	1
 to understand the potential impact of crowding out   consider the situation of the us economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late <num>  	0
 in <num>   for example   the budget deficit was roughly <num>   of gdp  	0
 imagine  central bank faced with  government that is running large budget deficits   causing  rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment  	0
 if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential gdp   threatening an inflationary increase in price levels   the central bank may react with  contractionary monetary policy  	0
 in this situation   the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy   and the government borrowing might crowd out  great deal of private investment  	0
 on the other hand   if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential gdp   an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of  danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy  	0
 not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government   many college students in the united states pay  substantial share of the cost of their education  	0
 if low   income countries of the world are going to experience  widespread increase in their education levels for grade   school children   government spending seems likely to play  substantial role  	0
 exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits  	0
 <link> shows  situation using the exchange rate for the us dollar   measured in euros  	0
 at the original equilibrium   <chem>     where the demand for us dollars   <chem>   intersects with the supply of us dollars   <chem>   on the foreign exchange market   the exchange rate is <num> euros per us dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is   <num> billion per day   which was roughly the quantity of dollar   euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid  <num>    	0
 you will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations  	0
 as explained in the macroeconomic perspective   we must consider using purchasing power parity or   international dollars   to convert average incomes into comparable units  	0
 purchasing power parity   as formally defined in exchange rates and international capital flows   takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries  	0
 the macroeconomic perspective explained how to measure gdp   the challenges of using gdp to compare standards of living   and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution  	0
 where does economic growth come from  	0
 according to most economists who believe in the growth consensus   economic growth   as discussed in economic growth   is built on  foundation of productivity improvements  	0
 in turn   productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology   all interacting in  market   driven economy  	0
 lack of saving means  lack of capital accumulation and  lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital  	0
 recent research by two mit economists   abhijit bannerjee and esther duflo   has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty  	0
 for example   the average citizen of burundi   the lowest   income country   subsists on   <num> per year   adjusted to <num> dollars    	0
 according to data collected by the central intelligence agency in its cia factbook   as of <num>   <num>   of burundi   population is agrarian   with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop  	0
 the monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward   run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans   drive down interest rates   and increase aggregate demand  	0
 in  recession   there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off   and so even  central bank   with fighting inflation as its top priority   can usually justify some reduction in interest rates  	0
 with regard to fiscal policy   the automatic stabilizers discussed in government budgets and fiscal policy should be allowed to work   even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession  	0
 there is less agreement over whether   in addition to automatic stabilizers   governments in  recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases  	0
 policymakers of the high   income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation  	0
 first   whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run   monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term  	0
 there is  long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services   fear of job loss   environmental dangers   unfair labor practices   and many other concerns  	0
 these arguments are discussed at some length in the international trade and capital flows of all of the arguments for limitations on trade   perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument   that is   subsidizing or protecting new industries for  time until they become established  	1
   globalization and protectionism explains this concept in more detail  	0
 instead of offering net financial investment abroad   the us economy is soaking up savings from all over the world  	0
 these substantial us trade deficits may not be sustainable according to sebastian edwards writing for the national bureau of economic research  	0
 while trade deficits on their own are not bad   the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily  	0
 the first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of world war   	0
 over that time   global exports as  share of global gdp rose from less than <num>   of gdp in <num> to <num>   of gdp in <num>  	0
  country has an absolute advantage in producing  good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good  	1
 absolute advantage can be the result of  country   natural endowment  	0
 to simplify   let   say that saudi arabia and the united states each have <num> worker hours   see <link>    	0
 we illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using  production possibility frontier   ppf   graph   shown in <link>  	0
 recall from choice in  world of scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources   in this case workers   and its level of technology  	0
 absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of  worker between countries  	0
 it answers the question     how many inputs do  need to produce shoes in mexico    	0
 comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently  	0
 moreover   the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to  degree in certain products   and then exchange those products  	1
  high proportion of trade   however   is intra   industry trade   that is   trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another  	1
 for example   the united states produces and exports autos and imports autos  	0
 in fact   recent years have seen  trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain  	0
 the value chain describes how  good is produced in stages  	0
 as indicated in the beginning of the chapter   the production of the iphone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the united states   parts supplied from korea   the assembly of the parts in china   and the advertising and marketing done in the united states  	0
 tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for  variety of reasons  	1
 some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries   for humanitarian reasons   and protecting against dumping  	0
 when  government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism  	1
 protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition  	0
 nontariff barriers are all the other ways that  nation can draw up rules   regulations   inspections   and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products  	1
  rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas   for instance  	0
 the extra <num> tons of sugar production   shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in brazil   is exported to the united states  	0
 it matters because the support of farmers in high   income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in low   income countries  	0
 even when their climate and land are well   suited to products like cotton   rice   sugar   or milk   farmers in low   income countries find it difficult to compete  	0
 us producers obtain  higher price so they sell  larger quantity of sugar  	0
 the effects of  tariff on producers and consumers in the united states can be measured using two concepts developed in demand   supply   and efficiency   consumer surplus and producer surplus  	0
    	0
 sugar supply and demand when there is free trade   the equilibrium is at point   	0
 lost sales translate into lost jobs  	0
 the hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries  	0
 this is why the united states international trade commission   in its study of barriers to trade   predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs  	0
 workers in many low   income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for  worker in the united states  	0
 workers in countries like china   thailand   brazil   south africa   and poland are often paid less than the united states minimum wage  	0
 for example   in the united states   the minimum wage is   <num> per hour    typical wage in many low   income countries might be more like   <num> per day   or often much less  	0
 dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production  	1
 anti   dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production  	1
 since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the world trade organization   wto     nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file  complaint with the wto  	0
 in general   high   income countries such as the united states   canada   japan   and the nations of the european union have relatively strict environmental standards  	0
 in contrast   middle  and low   income countries like brazil   nigeria   india   and china have lower environmental standards  	0
 one final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security  	0
 in <num>   the united states became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms   so it declared wool and mohair to be   strategic materials   and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers  	0
 there are different types of economic integration across the globe   ranging from free trade agreements   in which participants allow each other   imports without tariffs or quotas   to common markets   in which participants have  common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group   to full economic unions   in which   in addition to  common market   monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated  	1
 many nations belong both to the world trade organization and to regional trading agreements  	0
 because of technotron   new technology   which in this case is importing goods from another county   other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers  	0
 just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down   it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade  	0
 to  mathematician or an economist    variable is the name given to  quantity that may assume  range of values  	1
 in the equation of  line presented above    and  are the variables   with  on the horizontal axis and  on the vertical axis   and  and  representing factors that determine the shape of the line  	0
  negative slope means that two variables are negatively related   that is   when  increases    decreases   or when  decreases    increases  	1
 graphically    negative slope means that   as the line on the line graph moves from left to right   the line falls  	0
 the data in <link> is displayed in <link> which shows the relationship between two variables   length and median weight for american baby boys and girls during the first three years of life  	0
   the median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less  	0

 for example   points  and  sit on the same indifference curve um   which means that they provide lilly with the same level of utility  	0
 thus   the marginal utility that lilly would gain from   say   increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from <num> to <num> so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points  and   	0
 indeed   the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution   which is the rate at which  person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same  	1
 this information provides the basis for the budget line shown in <link>  	0
 along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from <link>  	0

 the income effect refers to how  change in the price of  good alters the effective buying power of one   income  	1
 if the price of  good that you have been buying falls   then in effect your buying power has risen   you are able to purchase more goods  	0
 as explained in financial markets   the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events  	0
 the price of  bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make   including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond  	0
 all sales of the final goods and services that make up gdp will eventually end up as income for workers   for managers   and for investors and owners of firms  	0
 the sum of all the income received for contributing resources to gdp is called national income       	1
 at some points in the discussion that follows   it will be useful to refer to real gdp as   national income  	0
 both axes are measured in real   inflation   adjusted   terms  	0
 the final ingredient of the keynesian cross or expenditure   output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule   which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real gdp  	1
 the intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the <num> degree line   at point <chem> in <link>   will show the equilibrium for the economy   because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real gdp  	0
   exactly how  situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important   because even low   income societies are not literally at zero income   so the point is hypothetical  	0
 this relationship between income and consumption   illustrated in <link> and <link>   is called the consumption function  	1
 all the components of aggregate demand   consumption   investment   government spending   and the trade balance   are now in place to build the keynesian cross diagram  	0
 <link> builds up an aggregate expenditure function   based on the numerical illustrations of             and  that have been used throughout this text  	0
 the meaning of   equilibrium   remains the same   that is   equilibrium is  point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome  	1
 to understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the <num> degree line is  macroeconomic equilibrium   consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point    say point  in <link>   where output is higher than the equilibrium  	0
 in this way   the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once  	0
 this is called the multiplier effect   an initial increase in spending   cycles repeatedly through the economy and has  larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent  	1
 the equilibrium price is   <num> and the equilibrium quantity is <num> million  	0
 to see the benefits to consumers   look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left  	0
 this portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than   <num> for  tablet  	0
 the amount that  seller is paid for  good minus the seller   actual cost is called producer surplus  	1
 in <link>   producer surplus is the area labeled    that is   the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium  	0
 the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus   also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus  	1
 in <link>   social surplus would be shown as the area      	0
 social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity  	0
 the new consumer surplus is    and the new producer surplus is      	0
 economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity  	1
 these can be individual decisions   family decisions   business decisions or societal decisions  	0
 many authors had written on economics in the centuries before smith   but he was the first to address the subject in  comprehensive way  	0
 in the first chapter   smith introduces the division of labor   which means that the way  good or service is produced is divided into  number of tasks that are performed by different workers   instead of all the tasks being done by the same person  	1
 how can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals  	0
 monetary policy   which involves policies that affect bank lending   interest rates   and financial capital markets   is conducted by  nation   central bank  	1
 for the united states   this is the federal reserve  	0
 they analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior   that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use  	0
  theory is  simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other  	1
 the purpose of  theory is to take  complex   real   world issue and simplify it down to its essentials  	0
  good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram   which is shown in <link>  	0
 it pictures the economy as consisting of two groups   households and firms   that interact in two markets   the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees  	1
 although command economies have  very centralized structure for economic decisions   market economies have  very decentralized structure  	0
  market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services   who may be either individuals or businesses  	1
 the new york stock exchange   shown in <link>   is  prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together  	0
 exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad  	1
 imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically  	1
 the size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product   gdp    	1
 economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired  	1
 the idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else   in short   opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative  	0
 people desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide  	0
 utility   as we will see in the chapter on consumer choices   is subjective but that does not make it less real  	0
 just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices   society as  whole can not have everything it might want   either  	0
 this section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society   using  model called the production possibilities frontier   ppf    	0
 there are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice  	0
 this pattern is common enough that it has been given  name   the law of diminishing returns   which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to  certain purpose   the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline  	1
 when government spends  certain amount more on reducing crime   for example   the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large  	0
 allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods  society produces represents the combination that society most desires  	1
 how to determine what  society desires can be  controversial question   and is usually discussed in political science   sociology   and philosophy classes as well as in economics  	0
 rather   it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists  	0
 philosophers draw  distinction between positive statements   which describe the world as it is   and normative statements   which describe how the world should be  	0
 for example   an economist could analyze  proposed subway system in  certain city  	0
 but even if the budget constraint or  ppf shifts   scarcity remains   just at  different level  	0
 the second theme is tradeoffs  	0
 as depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier   it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good  	0
 finally   the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices  	0
 an economist might say that people choose not to get  college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college   and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today  	0
 price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded   qd   or supplied   qs   and the corresponding percent change in price  	1
 the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of  good or service divided by the percentage change in the price  	1
 the price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price  	1
 elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories   elastic   inelastic   and unitary  	0
 an elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one   indicating  high responsiveness to changes in price  	1
 elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply  	1
 unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply   as summarized in <link>  	1
 recall that the elasticity between these two points was <num>  	0
 demand was inelastic between points  and  and elastic between points  and hthis shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along  straight   line demand curve  	0
 zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity   as depicted in <link> refers to the extreme case in which  percentage change in price   no matter how large   results in zero change in quantity  	1
 while  perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example   goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves  	0
 the example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic   taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking   and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices  	0
 the analysis   or manner   of how the burden of  tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence  	1
 typically   the incidence   or burden   of  tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good  	0
 the cross   price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas  	0
 the term   cross   price   refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of  different good  	1
 let   define what is meant by the firm  	0
  firm   or business   combines inputs of labor   capital   land   and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs  	1
 if the firm is successful   the outputs are more valuable than the inputs  	0
 we can distinguish between two types of cost   explicit and implicit  	0
 explicit costs are out   of   pocket costs   that is   payments that are actually made  	1
 wages that  firm pays its employees or rent that  firm pays for its office are explicit costs  	0
 it means total revenue minus explicit costs   the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out  	0
 economic profit is total revenue minus total cost   including both explicit and implicit costs  	1
 the difference is important because even though  business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit   whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit  	0
 fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production   at least not in the short term  	1
 whether you produce  lot or  little   the fixed costs are the same  	0
 average total cost   sometimes referred to simply as average cost   is total cost divided by the quantity of output  	1
 since the total cost of producing <num> haircuts is   <num>   the average total cost for producing each of <num> haircuts is   <num> <num>   or   <num> per haircut  	0
 finally   the right   hand portion of the long   run average cost curve   running from output level <chem> to <chem>   shows  situation where   as the level of output and the scale rises   average costs rise as well  	1
 this situation is called diseconomies of scale  	0
  firm or  factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage   resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other   and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials  	0
 what  buyer pays for  unit of the specific good or service is called price  	1
 the total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded  	1
 when economists talk about supply   they mean the amount of some good or service  producer is willing to supply at each price  	1
 price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of  good or service  	1
  rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service   while  fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied  	0
 like demand   supply can be illustrated using  table or  graph  	0
  supply schedule is  table   like <link>   that shows the quantity supplied at  range of different prices  	1
 again   price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons  	0
 the point where the supply curve      and the demand curve      cross   designated by point  in <link>   is called the equilibrium  	1
 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree   that is   where the amount of the product consumers want to buy   quantity demanded   is equal to the amount producers want to sell   quantity supplied    	1
 the equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree   that is   where the amount of the product consumers want to buy   quantity demanded   is equal to the amount producers want to sell   quantity supplied    	1
 this common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity  	0
 when the price is below equilibrium   there is excess demand   or  shortage   that is   at the given price the quantity demanded   which has been stimulated by the lower price   now exceeds the quantity supplied   which had been depressed by the lower price  	1
 in this situation   eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations   only to find many stations running short of fuel  	0
 the assumption behind  demand curve or  supply curve is that no relevant economic factors   other than the product   price   are changing  	1
 economists call this assumption ceteris paribus    latin phrase meaning   other things being equal  	0
 any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal  	0
  demand curve or  supply curve is  relationship between two   and only two   variables when all other variables are kept constant  	0
 the proportion of elderly citizens in the united states population is rising  	0
 it rose from <num>   in <num> to <num>   in <num>   and will be  projected   by the us census bureau   <num>   of the population by <num>  	0
 these changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve  	0
 therefore    shift in demand happens when  change in some economic factor   other than price   causes  different quantity to be demanded at every price  	0
 the following work it out feature shows how this happens  	0
 for example   in <num> the manchurian plain in northeastern china   which produces most of the country   wheat   corn   and soybeans   experienced its most severe drought in <num> years  	0
  drought decreases the supply of agricultural products   which means that at any given price    lower quantity will be supplied   conversely   especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right  	0
 when  firm discovers  new technology that allows the firm to produce at  lower cost   the supply curve will shift to the right   as well  	0
 for instance   in the <num>  major scientific effort nicknamed the green revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice  	0
   well   it is clear that  drought reduces supply   so  will shift back the supply curve   as in the shift from the original supply curve <chem> to <chem> shown on the diagram   called shift <num>    	0
 so the equilibrium moves from <chem> to <chem>   the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher  	0
 then    higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good   so the supply curve shifts right   as shown by the shift from <chem> to <chem>   on the diagram   shown as shift <num>     so that the equilibrium now moves from <chem> to <chem>  	0
 the most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product   adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be  	0
 according to the common agricultural policy reform passed in <num>   the european union   eu   will spend about <num> billion euros per year   or <num> billion dollars per year   or roughly <num>   of the eu budget   on price supports for europe   farmers from <num> to <num>  	0
 <link> illustrates the effects of  government program that assures  price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in europe  	0
 in the absence of government intervention   the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point <chem>   with price <chem> and quantity <chem>  	0
 at that above   equilibrium salary   excess supply or  surplus results  	0
 in  situation of excess supply in the labor market   with many applicants for every job opening   employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have  	0
 nurses   salary will move down toward equilibrium in contrast   if the salary is below the equilibrium at   say     <num> <num> per year   then  situation of excess demand or  shortage arises  	0
 in mid  <num>   the us minimum wage was raised to   <num> per hour  	0
 local political movements in  number of us cities have pushed for  higher minimum wage   which they call  living wage  	0
 promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure  reasonable standard of living  	0
 the laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets  	0
 according to the law of demand    higher rate of return   that is    higher price   will decrease the quantity demanded  	1
 as the interest rate rises   consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow  	0
 instead   each consumer reacts according to that person   preferences and budget set   and each profit   seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits  	0
 the following clear it up feature examines the demand and supply models  	0
 to understand how  household will make its choices   economists look at what consumers can afford   as shown in  budget constraint line   and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices  	0
 in  budget constraint line   the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis  	1
 the most common pattern of total utility   as shown here   is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility   but at  decreasing rate  	0
 the third column shows marginal utility   which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption  	1
 this equation for marginal utility is   mu   change in total utility change in quantity mu   change in total utility change in quantity	0
 notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed   which means that each subsequent unit of  good consumed provides less additional utility  	0
 this process of decision making suggests  rule to follow when maximizing utility  	0
 since the price of    shirts is twice as high as the price of movies   to maximize utility the last    shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility   mu   of the last movie  	0
 how does this rise in income alter her utility   maximizing choice  	0
 kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility   maximizing choice on the new budget line  	0
 but how will her new choice relate to her original choice  	0
 this occurs for two reasons   and both effects can occur simultaneously  	0
 the substitution effect occurs when  price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with  relatively higher price and more of the good with  relatively lower price  	1
 the income effect is that  higher price means   in effect   the buying power of income has been reduced   even though actual income has not changed     which leads to buying less of the good   when the good is normal    	1
 again   let   proceed with  concrete example  	0
 the economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of  consumption choice budget constraint   but the labels are different on  labor   leisure budget constraint  	0
 <link> and <link> show yelberton   intertemporal budget constraint  	0
 yelberton   choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement  	0
 and what   more   actions under these conditions are indeed predictable   if the underlying environment is better understood  	0
 so   behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision   making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics  	1
 it does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation  	0
 industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in  specific market   how easy or difficult it is for  new firm to enter   and the type of products that are sold  	1
 this is referred to as the market structure of the industry  	0
 in this chapter   we focus on perfect competition  	0
  perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make   namely   what quantity to produce  	0
 to understand why this is so   consider  different way of writing out the basic definition of profit  	0
 in this example   the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at  price of   <num> and  quantity of <num> produced  	0
 if the farmer started out producing at  level of <num>   and then experimented with increasing production to <num>   marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs   and so profits would rise  	0
 no perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price  	0
 however   the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market  	0
 for an increasing cost industry   as the market expands   the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production   which makes the new zero   profit level intersect at  higher price than before  	1
 here companies may have to deal with limited inputs   such as skilled labor  	0
 to explore what is meant by allocative efficiency   it is useful to walk through an example  	0
 begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive   and so    mc  	0
 there are two types of monopoly   based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit  	0
 one is natural monopoly   where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition  	1
 the other is legal monopoly   where laws prohibit   or severely limit   competition  	1
 copyright office  	0
  patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make   use   or sell the invention for  limited time   in the united states   exclusive patent rights last for <num> years  	1
 the idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in     but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires  	0
 but in certain areas   like the invention of new software   it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply  	0
 there is also  body of law known as trade secrets  	0
 even if  company does not have  patent on an invention   competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets  	0
 businesses have developed  number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market  	0
 one method is known as predatory pricing   in which  firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition  	1
 predatory pricing is  violation of us antitrust law   but it is difficult to prove  	0
 for  perfect competitor   each additional unit sold brought  positive marginal revenue   because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price  	0
 but  monopolist can sell  larger quantity and see  decline in total revenue  	0
 when  monopolist increases sales by one unit   it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit   but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at  lower price  	0
  perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products   who all act as price takers in the face of the competition  	0
 if you recall   price takers are firms that have no market power  	1
 they simply have to take the market price as given  	0
 crew   and nordstrom       plus <num> more stores that sold women   specialty clothing   like motherhood maternity and victoria   secret    	0
 most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive  	0
 the other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly  	0
 oligopolistic markets are those dominated by  small number of firms  	1
 some intangible aspects may be promises like  guarantee of satisfaction or money back    reputation for high quality   services like free delivery   or offering  loan to purchase the product  	0
 finally   product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers  	0
 for example   many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but   because of past habits and advertising   they have strong preferences for certain brands  	0
 although the process by which  monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which  monopolist makes such decisions   two differences are worth remembering  	0
 first   although both  monopolist and  monopolistic competitor face downward   sloping demand curves   the monopolist   perceived demand curve is the market demand curve   while the perceived demand curve for  monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces  	0
 second    monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry   but  monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar   but differentiated   products  	0
 thus   although  monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term   the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run  	0
 remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit  	0
  zero economic profit means the firm   accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use  	1
 rather   they are oligopolies  	0
 oligopoly arises when  small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry  	1
 examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry   cable television   and commercial air travel  	0
 by acting together   oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output   charge  higher price   and divide up the profit among themselves  	0
 when firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high   it is called collusion  	1
  group of firms that have  formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called  cartel  	1
 the desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists  	0
 adam smith wrote in wealth of nations in <num>     people of the same trade seldom meet together   even for merriment and diversion   but the conversation ends in  conspiracy against the public   or in some contrivance to raise prices  	0
 each oligopolist   however   must worry that while it is holding down output   other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits  	0
 <link> shows the prisoner   dilemma for  two   firm oligopoly   known as  duopoly  	1
 if firms  and  both agree to hold down output   they are acting together as  monopoly and will each earn   <num> <num> in profits  	0
 one example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve   in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts   but not price increases  	1
 this situation is shown in <link>  	0
  corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become  single firm  	0
 when one firm purchases another   it is called an acquisition  	1
 in many cases   these large firms were organized in the legal form of    trust     in which  group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases   and  group of   trustees   then ran the companies as if they were  single firm  	1
 thus   when the us government passed the sherman antitrust act in <num> to limit the power of these trusts   it was called an antitrust law  	0
 in an early demonstration of the law   power   the us supreme court in <num> upheld the government   right to break up standard oil   which had controlled about <num>   of the country   oil refining   into <num> independent firms   including exxon   mobil   amoco   and chevron  	0
 regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry  	0
 an early tool was the concentration ratio   which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms   typically the top four to eight firms  	1
 for an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy   refer to monopoly  	0
 say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in  certain city has <num> firms with the market shares shown in <link>   where the market share is each firm   proportion of total sales in that market  	1
 defining  market is often controversial  	0
 for example   microsoft in the early <num> had  dominant share of the software for computer operating systems  	0
 antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices   practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced   but that might have the effect of reducing competition  	1
 antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial   because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others for example   if  product manufacturer is selling to  group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand  minimum resale price maintenance agreement   which would require the dealers to sell for at least  certain minimum price  	0
 tying sales happen when  customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys  second product  	1
 tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase  product that they may not actually want or need  	0
 all sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with windows   both software produced by microsoft and that produced by other companies   had expanded dramatically in the <num>  	0
 having  monopoly or  near   monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself   but in cases where one company controls  great deal of the market   antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care  	0
 the regulators will try to choose  point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest  	0
 point  illustrates one tempting choice   the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of <num>   and charge the price of <num>   which is equal to marginal cost at that point  	0
 this rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost   which is what would occur in  perfectly competitive market   and it would assure consumers  higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice   	0
 beginning in the <num>   it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well  	0
 the united states carried out  great policy experiment   the deregulation discussed in monopoly   removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines   railroads   trucking   intercity bus travel   natural gas   and bank interest rates  	1

 the collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of lehman brothers    major investment bank   numerous large commercial banks   such as wachovia   and even the federal national mortgage corporation   fannie mae     which had to be nationalized   that is   taken over by the federal government  	1
 one response to the financial crisis was the dodd   frank act   which attempted major reforms of the financial system  	0
 the legislation   purpose   as noted on dodd frank com is  	0
 the effect of  market exchange on  third party who is outside or   external   to the exchange is called an externality  	1
 because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved   they are sometimes called spillovers externalities can be negative or positive  	0
 if you hate country music   then having it waft into your house every night would be  negative externality  	0
 pollution is  negative externality  	0
 economists illustrate the social costs of production with  demand and supply diagram  	0
 the social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society  	1
 however   when the externality of pollution exists   the supply curve no longer represents all social costs  	0
 because externalities represent  case where markets no longer consider all social costs   but only some of them   economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure  	0
 when there is market failure   the private market fails to achieve efficient output   because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained    positive externality    	1
 in the same year   the clean air act was enacted to address air pollution  	0
 just two years later   in <num>   congress passed and the president signed the far   reaching clean water act  	0
 these command   and   control environmental laws   and their amendments and updates   have been largely responsible for america   cleaner air and water in recent decades  	0
 when  city or state government sets up  marketable permit program    gcap   and   trade     it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards  	0
 however   it also found that  middle   range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was   <num> trillion   about <num> times higher than the costs  	0
  more recent study by the epa estimated that the environmental benefits to americans from the clean air act will exceed their costs by  margin of four to one  	0
 the epa estimated that   in <num> the benefits of clean air act programs will total about   <num> billion  	0
 however   as the extent of environmental protection increases   the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease   and more costly methods must be used  	0
 the marginal cost curve rises  	0
 also   as environmental protection increases   the largest marginal benefits are achieved first   followed by reduced marginal benefits  	0
 however   low   income countries   with some understandable exasperation   point out that high   income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth  	0
 after all   high   income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels   and still are today  	0
 it is hard to tell people who are living in  low   income country   where adequate diet   health care   and education are lacking   that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for  cleaner environment  	0
 depending on their different income levels and political preferences   countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency   that is   the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier  	1
 however   all countries should prefer to make  choice that shows productive efficiency   that is   the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it  	0
 in certain cases   however   competition can discourage new technology   especially when other firms can quickly copy  new idea  	0
 consider  pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop  new drug  	0
 however   when  firm invests in new technology   the private benefits   or profits   that the firm receives are only  portion of the overall social benefits  	0
 the social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product   whether enjoyed by other companies or society as  whole   as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology  	1
 as you learned in environmental protection and negative externalities   positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to  third party   or parties consider the example of the big drug company   which is planning its   budget for the next year  	1
 data in <link>   from the us bureau of labor statistics   usual weekly earnings of wage and salary workers   third quarter <num>   demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education  	0
 while these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in treasury bonds or savings accounts   the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker   so these returns are private rates of return to education  	0

 instead   public goods have two defining characteristics   they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous  	0
 the first characteristic   that  public good is nonexcludable   means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good  	1
 goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called common resources  	1

 the united states does have an estate tax   that is    tax imposed on the value of an inheritance   which suggests  willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance  	1
 however   according to the center on budget and policy priorities   in <num> the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than   <num> million and thus applies to only  tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth  	0
 what are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive  	0
 to analyze these questions   let   consider  situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with  single union   and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion labor  	0
 if no labor union existed in this market   then equilibrium      in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor      and the supply of labor      in <link>  	0
 in the past   presidential use of the taft   hartley act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but   in this case   it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement in other instances   unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies  	0
 in one prominent example   during the <num> and <num>   the united mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor   saving machinery in the mines  	0
 the mineworkers   union realized that over time   the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines   but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive   and mechanization was  necessary step toward greater productivity  	0
 discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of  certain group are inferior solely because of  factor such as race   gender   or religion  	1
 there are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets   which arises if workers with the same skill levels   as measured by education   experience   and expertise   receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender  	0
 if some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and or minorities  wage based on their productivity   then other profit   seeking employers can hire these workers  	0
 in  competitive market   if the owners of  business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin   they will have an incentive to make buying   selling   hiring   and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors  	0
 supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns  	0
 those who express concern about immigration levels to the united states point to graphics like <link> which shows total inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century  	0
 clearly   the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years   reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century  	0
 the general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed   but often disclosure is not made  	0
 as such   many buyers face  situation of asymmetric information   where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information   one party knows much more than the other    	1
 for  market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product   price and quality  	0
 if there is limited information   then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions  	0
 when buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products   then markets may have trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity  	0
 imagine  situation where  used car dealer has  lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling   and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell  greater quantity  	0
 in the goods market   the seller of  good might offer  money   back guarantee   an agreement that functions as  promise of quality  	1
 this strategy may be especially important for  company that sells goods through mail   order catalogs or over the web   whose customers can not see the actual products   because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it  	0
 sellers of labor provide information through resumes   recommendations   school transcripts   and examples of their work  	0
 occupational licenses are also used to establish quality in the labor market  	0
 occupational licenses   which are typically issued by government agencies   show that  worker has completed  certain type of education or passed  certain test  	1
 in the financial capital market   before  bank makes  loan   it requires  prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income   in addition   the bank conducts  credit check on the individual   past borrowing  	0
 another approach is to require  cosigner on  loan   that is   another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so  	1
 yet another approach is to require collateral   often property or equipment that the bank would have  right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid  	1
 pension insurance   employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay  small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the pension benefit guarantee corporation   which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if  company goes bankrupt and can not pay the pensions it has promised  	1
 retirement insurance   all workers pay  percentage of their income into social security and into medicare   which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly  	1
 social security and medicare are not literally   insurance   in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits  	0
 another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay  share of the costs  	0
 for example   insurance policies often have deductibles   which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying  	1
 for example   auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than   <num>  	0
  final way of reducing moral hazard   which is especially applicable to health care   is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care   rather than consumers  	0
 traditionally   most health care in the united states has been provided on  fee   for   service basis   which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services  	1
 however   in the last decade or so   the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations   hmos    	0
 the affordable care act   aca   will be funded through additional taxes to include  	0
 firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future  	0
 examples include when  firm buys  machine that will last <num> years   or builds  new plant that will last for <num> years   or starts  research and development project  	0
 firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways     <num>   from early   stage investors     <num>   by reinvesting profits     <num>   by borrowing through banks or bonds   and   <num>   by selling stock  	0
 in this way   an individual investor could   in effect   loan the firm   <num> <num>   or any multiple of that amount  	0
 anyone who owns  bond and receives the interest payments is called  bondholder  	1
 if  firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments   the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay   even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment  	0
 those who buy the stock become the owners   or shareholders   of the firm  	0
 stock represents ownership of  firm   that is    person who owns <num>   of  company   stock   by definition   owns the entire company  	1
 the stock of  company is divided into shares  	0
 that rate of return can come in two forms  	0
  firm can make  direct payment to its shareholders   called  dividend  	1
 alternatively    financial investor might buy  share of stock in wal   mart for   <num> and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for   <num>   for  gain of   <num>  	0
  private company is owned by the people who run it on  day   to   day basis  	0
  private company can be run by individuals   in which case it is called  sole proprietorship   or it can be run by  group   in which case it is  partnership  	1
  private company can also be  corporation   but with no publicly issued stock  	0
  high   risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years  	0
 the actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return   including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of  period of time  	1
  checking account typically pays little or no interest   but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money   either by writing  check or by using  debit card   that is    card which works like  credit card   except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through  credit card company    	1

  savings account typically pays some interest rate   but getting the money typically requires you to make  trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine   or you can access the funds electronically    	1
 the lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades   as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to  savings account if you keep  certain minimum amount in the account   or conversely   offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least  few checks per month  	0
 firms that appear to be riskier borrowers   perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky   will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds  	0
 bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called high yield bonds or junk bonds  	1
  number of today   well   known firms issued junk bonds in the <num> when they were starting to grow   including turner broadcasting and microsoft  	0
   bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest  	0
 the bond has  maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment  	1
 combining the bond   face value   interest rate   and maturity date   and market interest rates   allows  buyer to compute  bond   present value   which is the most that  buyer would be willing to pay for  given bond  	0
 <link> shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds   <num>  year treasury bonds   which are officially called   notes     and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an aaa rating as relatively safe borrowers by moody     an independent firm that publishes such ratings  	0
 even though corporate bonds pay  higher interest rate   because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government   the rates tend to rise and fall together  	0
 purchasing  diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the internet age   but it remains something of  task  	0
 to simplify the process   companies offer mutual funds   which are organizations that buy  range of stocks or bonds from different companies  	1
 the financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund   and then receives  return based on how the fund as  whole performs  	0
 the chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing  	0
 thus   in attempting to get rich in the stock market   it is no help to identify  company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion   because the stock price will already be high   based on the expected high level of future profits the idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has  powerful and unexpected implication  	0
 for example   many us drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made   they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it  	0
 in september <num>   president obama and congress enacted  tariff   taxes added on imported goods   on tires imported from china that would increase the import price of chinese tires by <num> percent in its first year   <num> percent in its second year   and <num> percent in its third year  	1
 interestingly   the us companies that make tires did not favor this step   because most of them also import tires from china and other countries  	0
 as this example suggests   we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in environmental protection and negative externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and pollution   the problem called regulatory capture   which we defined in monopoly and antitrust policy    	0
 in legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes   or rules for safety in the workplace   or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations   you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma  	0
 they talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording  	0
 politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district   where it will benefit their constituents in  direct and obvious way  	0
 thus   when legislators are negotiating over whether to support  piece of legislation   they commonly ask each other to include pork   barrel spending   legislation that benefits mainly  single political district  	1
 pork   barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs   the benefits of pork   barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters   while the costs are spread over the entire country  	0
 does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas  	0
 clearly there are more sugar consumers in the united states than sugar producers   but the us domestic sugar lobby   www sugarcane org   has successfully argued for protection against imports since <num>  	0

 investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment   primarily by businesses  	1
 if starbucks builds  new store   or amazon buys robots   these expenditures are counted under business investment  	0
 everything that is purchased must be produced first  	0
 <link> breaks down what is produced into five categories   durable goods   nondurable goods   services   structures   and the change in inventories  	0
 before going into detail about these categories   notice that total gdp measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the gdp measured by looking at the five components of demand  	0
 net national product   nnp   is calculated by taking gnp and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out   or reduced in value because of aging   over the course of  year  	1
 the process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation  	1
 the nnp can be further subdivided into national income   which includes all income to businesses and individuals   and personal income   which includes only income to people  	1
 the nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time  	1
 the real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation  	1
 generally   it is the real value that is more important  	0
 because <num> is the base year   the nominal and real values are exactly the same in that year  	0
 however   over time   the rise in nominal gdp looks much larger than the rise in real gdp   that is   the nominal gdp line rises more steeply than the real gdp line     because the rise in nominal gdp is exaggerated by the presence of inflation   especially in the <num>    	0
 nominal and real gdp   <num>   <num>	0
 the red line measures us gdp in nominal dollars  	0
 an especially lengthy and deep recession is called  depression  	1
 the severe drop in gdp that occurred during the great depression of the <num> is clearly visible in the figure   as is the great recession of <num>   <num>  	0
  private think tank   the national bureau of economic research   nber     is the official tracker of business cycles for the us economy  	0
 however   the effects of  severe recession often linger on after the official ending date assigned by the nber  	0
 key concepts and summary	0
 so is the us economy larger than other countries just because the united states has more people than most other countries   or because the us economy is actually larger on  per   person basis  	0
 this question can be answered by calculating  country   gdp per capita   that is   the gdp divided by the population  	1
 gdp has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society  	0
 gdp per capita is only an average  	0
 when gdp per capita rises by <num>     it could mean that gdp for everyone in the society has risen by <num>     or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less   or even declined  	0
 according to the dutch economic historian jan luiten van zanden   slavery   based societies   favorable demographics   global trading routes   and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the industrial revolution to succeed  	0
 the industrial revolution refers to the widespread use of power   driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the <num>  	1
 ingenious machines   the steam engine   the power loom   and the steam locomotive   performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do  	0
 in other words   how efficient is your nation with its time and workers  	0
 labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input  	1
 the easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine  canadian worker who can make <num> loaves of bread in an hour versus  us worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread  	0
 to analyze the sources of economic growth   it is useful to think about  production function   which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor   machinery   and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers  	1
  microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of  firm   or perhaps an industry  	0
 it causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time  	0
 similarly   compound rates of economic growth   or the compound growth rate   means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by  base that includes past gdp growth   with dramatic effects over time  	1
 it may not make sense to compare the gdps of china and say   benin   simply because of the great difference in population size  	0
 to understand economic growth   which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person   it is often useful to focus on gdp per capita  	0
 using gdp per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people   like belgium   uruguay   or zimbabwe   with countries that have larger populations   like the united states   the russian federation   or nigeria  	0
 special economic zones  	0
 the island of mauritius is one of the few african nations to encourage international trade in government   supported special economic zones   sez    	0
 these are areas of the country   usually with access to  port where   among other benefits   the government does not tax trade  	1
  first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns  	0
 even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase gdp per capita   the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital   the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish  	1
 for example   raising the average education level of the population by two years from  tenth   grade level to  high school diploma   while holding all other inputs constant   would produce  certain increase in output  	0
 an economy with high unemployment is like  company operating with  functional but unused factory  	0
 the opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers  	0
 they are   however   also counted in the employed group  	0
 all of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term   hidden unemployment   discouraged workers   those who have stopped looking for employment and   hence   are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group	1
 the timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy  	0
 during periods of recession and depression   unemployment is high  	0
 during periods of economic growth   unemployment tends to be lower  	0
 the variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion    	1
 the business cycle   is known as cyclical unemployment  	0
 one set of reasons why wages may be   sticky downward     as economists put it   involves economic laws and institutions  	0
 for low   skilled workers being paid the minimum wage   it is illegal to reduce their wages  	0
 for union workers operating under  multiyear contract with  company   wage cuts might violate the contract and create  labor dispute or  strike  	0
 efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay   and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate  	1
 one reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs   they would suffer  decline in salary  	0
 the insider   outsider model of the labor force   in simple terms   argues that those already working for firms are   insiders     while new employees   at least for  time   are   outsiders  	1
  firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization   to be familiar with routine procedures   to train new employees   and so on  	0
 however   cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm   productivity and prospects  	0
 finally   the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see  decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such  decline   there is no obvious way for  decentralized economy to implement such  plan  	1
 instead   workers confronted with the possibility of  wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such  wage cut   and so  wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others  	0
 but in the real world   even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies   it takes time to find out about new jobs   to interview and figure out if the new job is  good match   or perhaps to sell  house and buy another in proximity to  new job  	0
 the unemployment that occurs in the meantime   as workers move between jobs   is called frictional unemployment  	1
 frictional unemployment is not inherently  bad thing  	0
 inflation is  general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy  	1
 inflation does not refer to  change in relative prices  	0
 to calculate the price level   economists begin with the concept of  basket of goods and services   consisting of the different items individuals   businesses   or organizations typically buy  	0
 the next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time  	0
 price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time  	1
 to convert the money spent on the basket to an index number   economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year   or starting point from which we measure changes in prices  	0
 the base year   by definition   has an index number equal to <num>  	0
  fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods   regardless of price changes   not  very likely assumption  	0
 thus   substitution bias   the rise in the price of  fixed basket of goods over time   tends to overstate the rise in  consumer   true cost of living   because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen  	1
 the bls also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods  	0
 for example   the producer price index   ppi   is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services  	1
 it can be broken down into price indices for different industries   commodities   and stages of processing   like finished goods   intermediate goods   crude materials for further processing   and so on    	0
 an employment cost index measures wage inflation in the labor market  	0
 the gdp deflator   measured by the bureau of economic analysis   is  price index that includes all the components of gdp   that is   consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports    	1
 unlike the cpi   its baskets are not fixed but re   calculate what that year   gdp would have been worth using the base   year   prices  	0
 inflation in china averaged about <num>   per year for much of the <num> and early <num>   although it has dropped off since then  	0
 russia experienced hyperinflation   an outburst of high inflation   of <num> <num>   per year in the early <num>   although by <num> russia   consumer price inflation had dipped below <num>   per year   as shown in <link>  	1
 the closest the united states has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the civil war   <num>   <num>   in the confederate states  	0
 countries with relatively high inflation rates   <num>   <num>	0
 these charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year   consumer prices in brazil   china   and russia  	0
 economists note that over most periods   the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages   and so they reason that   on average   over time   people   economic status is not greatly changed by inflation  	0
 if all prices   wages   and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation   as in the land of funny money   then no one   purchasing power   profits   or real loan payments would change  	0
 moreover   the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful   prolonged conflicts between employers and employees  	0
 if the minimum wage is adjusted for inflation only infrequently   minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages   as shown in <link>  	0
 us minimum wage and inflation after adjusting for inflation   the federal minimum wage dropped more than <num> percent from <num> to <num>   even though the nominal figure climbed from   <num> to   <num> per hour  	0
 prices are the messengers in  market economy   conveying information about conditions of demand and supply  	0
 inflation blurs those price messages  	0
 second   an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible  	0
 the discussion in unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result  	0
 in the <num> and <num>   labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost   of   living adjustments   colas   which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation  	1
 these contracts were sometimes written as   for example   cola plus <num>    	0
 also   social security is funded by payroll taxes   which are imposed on the income earned up to  certain amount     <num> <num> in <num>  	0
 this level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation   so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the social security tax base  	0
 as yet another example of  government program affected by indexing   in <num> the us   government began offering indexed bonds  	0
 bonds are means by which the us government   and many private   sector companies as well   borrows money   that is   investors buy the bonds   and then the government repays the money with interest  	1
 recall from the macroeconomic perspective that if exports exceed imports   the economy is said to have  trade surplus  	0
 if imports exceed exports   the economy is said to have  trade deficit  	1
 if exports and imports are equal   then trade is balanced  	0
 old habits are hard to break  	0
 economists   however   typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid  	0
 the second row of <link> provides data on trade in services  	0
 here   the us economy is running  surplus  	0
 although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods   the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades  	0
 some of the other countries listed include brazil   the largest economy in latin america   nigeria   the largest economy in africa   and china   india   and korea  	0
 the first column offers one measure of the globalization of an economy   exports of goods and services as  percentage of gdp  	0
 the second column shows the trade balance  	0
 the connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the balance of payments  	0
 each category of the current account balance involves  corresponding flow of payments between  given country and the rest of the world economy  	0
 the national saving and investment identity provides  useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance  	0
 in  nation   financial capital market   the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments  	0
 what is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital  	0
 for most years of the nineteenth century   us imports exceeded exports and the us economy had  trade deficit  	0
 yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all   instead   the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the us economy the highest per capita gdp in the world by around <num>  	0
 the balance of trade is  separate issue from the level of trade  	0
 the united states has  low level of trade   but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid  <num> into the <num>  	0
 those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of  famous french economist of the early nineteenth century named jean   baptiste say   <num>   <num>    	0
 say   law is     supply creates its own demand  	0
 as  matter of historical accuracy   it seems clear that say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs   but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing  point of view  	0
 the intuition behind say   law is that each time  good or service is produced and sold   it generates income that is earned for someone    worker    manager   an owner   or those who are workers   managers   and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production  	1
 to be sure   even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand   the economy could still experience  situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses  	0
 nevertheless    recession is not  situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes  	0
  recession is  situation in which the economy as  whole is shrinking in size   business failures outnumber the remaining success stories   and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers  	1
 to build  useful macroeconomic model   we need  model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy   and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level  	1
 this model is called the aggregate demand   aggregate supply model  	0
 this module will explain aggregate supply   aggregate demand   and the equilibrium between them  	0
 if firms across the economy face  situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising   but their costs of production are not rising   then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production the slope of an as curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right  	0
 at the far left of the aggregate supply curve   the level of output in the economy is far below potential gdp   which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor   physical capital   and technology   in the context of its existing market and legal institutions  	1
 at these relatively low levels of output   levels of unemployment are high   and many factories are running only part   time   or have closed their doors  	0
 this demand is determined by  number of factors   but one of them is the price level   recall though   that the price level is an index number such as the gdp deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy  	1
 the aggregate demand   ad   curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level  	1
 <link> presents an aggregate demand   ad   curve  	0
 just like the aggregate supply curve   the horizontal axis shows real gdp and the vertical axis shows the price level  	0
 in the long run   however   producers are limited to producing at potential gdp  	0
 for this reason   what we have been calling the as curve   will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply   sras   curve  	0
 the vertical line at potential gdp may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply   lras   curve  	0
 productivity means how much output can be produced with  given quantity of labor  	1
 one measure of this is output per worker or gdp per capita  	0
 over time   productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output  	0
 the university of michigan publishes  survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month  	0
 the survey results are then reported at <link>   which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels  	0
 the ad   as model can be used to illustrate both say   law that supply creates its own demand and keynes   law that demand creates its own supply  	0
 consider the three zones of the sras curve as identified in <link>   the keynesian zone   the neoclassical zone   and the intermediate zone keynes   neoclassical   and intermediate zones in the aggregate supply curvenear the equilibrium ek   in the keynesian zone at the far left of the sras curve   small shifts in ad   either to the right or the left   will affect the output level yk   but will not much affect the price level  	0
 finally   consider the intermediate zone of the sras curve in <link>  	0
 if the ad curve crosses this portion of the sras curve at an equilibrium point like ei   then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions  	0
 the economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment   as shown at <chem> in the <link>  	0
 keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in  recessionary gap   with its attendant unemployment   for  significant period of time  	0
 in the same way   though not shown in the figure     if ad increases   the economy could experience an inflationary gap   where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output  	1
 as  consequence   the economy experiences inflation  	0
 disposable income   for most people   the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take   home pay   also known as disposable income   which is income after taxes  	1
 instead   prices and wages are   sticky     making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential gdp  	0
 keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky   the coordination argument  	0
 this argument points out that   even if most people would be willing   at least hypothetically   to see  decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such  decline    market   oriented economy has no obvious way to implement  plan of coordinated wage reductions  	1
  key concept in keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier  	0
 the expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of gdp   but that spending is powerful  	1
 the keynesian theory implied that during  recession inflationary pressures are low   but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential gdp   the economy is at greater risk for inflation  	0
 phillips analyzed <num> years of british data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation   which became known as  phillips curve  	1
 <link> shows  theoretical phillips curve   and the following work it out feature shows how the pattern appears for the united states  	0
 keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to  recession is expansionary fiscal policy   such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment   or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right  	1
 for example   if aggregate demand was originally at adr in <link>   so that the economy was in recession   the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from adr to adf   where the economy would be at potential gdp and full employment  	0
 this focus on long   run growth rather than the short   run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long   run macroeconomic analysis and keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run  	0
 let   consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn   and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand   aggregate supply model  	0
 the importance of potential gdp in the long run	0
 one subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed  	0
 the theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can   using all information available to them  	1
 in an economy where most people have rational expectations   economic adjustments may happen very quickly  	0
 as inflation fluctuates   so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods  	0
 the nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate   plus an expected inflation factor  	1
 expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy  	0
 fighting unemployment or inflation as explained in unemployment   unemployment can be divided into two categories   cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment   which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment  	1
 cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential gdp   giving potential employers less incentive to hire  	1
 each approach   keynesian and neoclassical   has its strengths and weaknesses the short   term keynesian model   built on the importance of aggregate demand as  cause of business cycles and  degree of wage and price rigidity   does  sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls  	1
 by focusing on the short   run adjustments of aggregate demand   keynesian economics risks overlooking the long   term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential gdp  	0
 the discussion of money and banking is  central component in the study of macroeconomics  	0
 at this point   you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from welcome to economics  	0
   economic growth   low unemployment   and low inflation  	0
 we have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our macroeconomic goals you should also understand keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand   aggregate supply   ad   as   model  	0
 barter   literally trading one good or service for another   is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in  modern advanced economy  	1
 in an economy without money   an exchange between two people would involve  double coincidence of wants    situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide  	1
 for example   if an accountant wants  pair of shoes   this accountant must find someone who has  pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services  	0
 this function of money does not require that money is  perfect store of value  	0
 in an economy with inflation   money loses some buying power each year   but it remains money third   money serves as  unit of account   which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured  	0
 for example   an accountant may charge   <num> to file your tax return  	0
 gold   silver   cowrie shells   cigarettes   and even cocoa beans have been used as money  	0
 although these items are used as commodity money   they also have  value from use as something other than money  	0
 gold   for example   has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes  	0
 rather than trying to state  single way of measuring money   economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity  	0
 liquidity refers to how quickly  financial asset can be used to buy  good or service  	1
 for example   cash is very liquid  	0
 <chem> money supply includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash   checkable   demand   deposits   and traveler   checks <chem> money supply is less liquid in nature and includes <chem> plus savings and time deposits   certificates of deposits   and money market funds  	1
 <chem> money supply includes coins and currency in circulation   the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the us treasury   at the federal reserve bank   or in bank vaults  	1
 closely related to currency are checkable deposits   also known as demand deposits  	0
 these are the amounts held in checking accounts  	1
 many banks and other financial institutions also offer  chance to invest in money market funds   where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in  safe way   such as short   term government bonds  	1
 another ingredient of <chem> are the relatively small   that is   less than about   <num> <num>   certificates of deposit   cds   or time deposits   which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for  certain period of time   ranging from  few months to  few years   in exchange for  higher interest rate  	1
 in short   all these types of <chem> are money that you can withdraw and spend   but which require  greater effort to do so than the items in <chem> <link> should help in visualizing the relationship between <chem> and <chem>  	0
 until you pay the credit card bill   you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company  	0
 with  smart card   you can store  certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases  	0
 some   smart cards   used for specific purposes   like long   distance phone calls or making purchases at  campus bookstore and cafeteria   are not really all that smart   because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places in short   credit cards   debit cards   and smart cards are different ways to move money when  purchase is made  	0
 also   those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in  bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at  later date  	0
 those who want to borrow money can go directly to  bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash transaction costs are the costs associated with finding  lender or  borrower for this money  	1
 thus   banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries   they bring savers and borrowers together  	0
  credit union is  nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run  	1
 members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be  member  	0
 if you own  home   this is also considered an asset  	0
  liability is  debt or something you owe  	1
 many people borrow money to buy homes  	0
 <link> illustrates  hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the safe and secure bank  	0
 because of the two   column format of the balance sheet   with the    shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under   assets   and   liabilities     it is sometimes called     account  	0
 these bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset   the bank will receive  stream of payments in the future  	0
 in our example   the safe and secure bank holds bonds worth  total value of   <num> million  	0
 the final entry under assets is reserves   which is money that the bank keeps on hand   and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds   and thus does not lead to interest payments  	1
 the federal reserve requires that banks keep  certain percentage of depositors   money on   reserve     which means either in their vaults or kept at the federal reserve bank  	0
 the risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because  bank   liabilities   namely the deposits of its customers   can be withdrawn quickly   but many of the bank   assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades  	0
 this asset   liability time mismatch    bank   liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term   can cause severe problems for  bank  	0
 for example   imagine  bank that has loaned  substantial amount of money at  certain interest rate   but then sees interest rates rise substantially  	0
 in making decisions about the money supply    central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and   in this way   to influence macroeconomic policy   whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation  	1
 the central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation   banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank   balance sheet  	0
 the answer is the chair of the federal reserve board of governors  	0
 in early <num>   janet lyellen   shown in <link> became the first woman to hold this post  	0
 yellen has been described in the media as   perhaps the most qualified fed chair in history  	0
 with  ph din economics from yale university   yellen has taught macroeconomics at harvard   the london school of economics   and most recently at the university of california at berkeley  	0
 regulation falls into  number of categories   including reserve requirements   capital requirements   and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make  	0
 in money and banking   we learned that banks are required to hold  minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves  	0
   on hand   is  bit of  misnomer because   while  portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank   the majority are held in the bank   account at the federal reserve   and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors  	0
 the national credit union administration   ncua   supervises credit unions   which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members  	1
 there are over <num> <num> credit unions in the us economy   though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks  	0
 the federal reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions  	0
 to protect against bank runs   congress has put two strategies into place   deposit insurance and the lender of last resort  	0
 deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in  bank do not lose their money   even if the bank goes bankrupt  	1
 the most important function of the federal reserve is to conduct the nation   monetary policy  	0
 article    section <num> of the us constitution gives congress the power   to coin money   and   to regulate the value thereof  	0
 as part of the <num> legislation that created the federal reserve   congress delegated these powers to the fed  	0
 where did the federal reserve get the   <num> million that it used to purchase the bonds  	0
  central bank has the power to create money  	0
 as  result of the panic   the federal reserve was founded to be the   lender of last resort  	0
 in the event of  bank run   sound banks     banks that were not bankrupt   could borrow as much cash as they needed from the fed   discount   window   to quell the bank run  	1
 in the event of  bank run   sound banks     banks that were not bankrupt   could borrow as much cash as they needed from the fed   discount   window   to quell the bank run  	1
 the interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the discount rate  	1
   they are so named because loans are made against the bank   outstanding loans   at  discount   of their face value  	0
 recall that the specific interest rate the fed targets is the federal funds rate  	1
 the federal reserve has   since <num>   established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations  	0
 <link>      illustrates this situation  	0
 this example uses  short   run upward   sloping keynesian aggregate supply curve   sras    	0
 the original equilibrium during  recession of <chem> occurs at an output level of <num>  	0
 in late <num>   as the us economy struggled with recession   the federal reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near   zero  	0
 with the recession still ongoing   the fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing   qe    	0
 this is the purchase of long   term government and private mortgage   backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand  	1
 similarly   sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in  recession   because they recognize that firms   sales and employees   jobs are more insecure in  recession   and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments  	0
 the result is that during an especially deep recession   an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real gdp  	0
 deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative   that is   instead of money having less purchasing power over time   as occurs with inflation   money is worth more  	1
 deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address  recession  	0
 if velocity is constant over time   then  certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left   hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal gdp   although this change could happen through an increase in inflation   or an increase in real gdp   or some combination of the two  	0
 if velocity is changing over time but in  constant and predictable way   then changes in the money supply will continue to have  predictable effect on nominal gdp  	0
 by <num>   central banks in <num> countries   including austria   brazil   canada   israel   korea   mexico   new zealand   spain   sweden   thailand   and the united kingdom faced  legal requirement to target the inflation rate  	0
  notable exception is the federal reserve in the united states   which does not practice inflation   targeting  	0
 instead   the law governing the federal reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account economists have no final consensus on whether  central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion  	0
 for example   from <num> to <num> during what was known as the   dot   com   boom   the us stock market   which is measured by the dow jones industrial index   which includes <num> very large companies from across the us economy     nearly tripled in value  	0
 the nasdaq index   which includes many smaller technology companies   increased in value by  multiple of five from <num> to <num>  	0
 these rates of increase were clearly not sustainable  	0
 the discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy   that is   the view of monetary policy within an economy  	1
 exchange rates and international capital flows explores the international dimension of monetary policy   and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of financial capital  	0
 the problem of the zero percent interest rate lower bound	0
 with these exceptions duly noted   most of the international economy takes place in  situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling   buying   hiring   borrowing   traveling   or investing across national borders  	0
 the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the foreign exchange market  	1
 financial investments that cross international boundaries   and require exchanging currency   are often divided into two categories  	0
 foreign direct investment   fdi   refers to purchasing  firm   at least ten percent   in another country or starting up  new enterprise in  foreign country	1
 for example   in <num> the belgian beer   brewing company inbev bought the us beer   maker anheuser   busch for   <num> billion  	0
 to make this purchase of  us firm   inbev would have to supply euros   the currency of belgium   to the foreign exchange market and demand us dollars  	0
 most people and firms who are exchanging  substantial quantity of currency go to  bank   and most banks provide foreign exchange as  service to customers  	1
 these banks   and  few other firms     known as dealers   then trade the foreign exchange  	0
 this is called the interbank market  	0
 this means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries   in this case   the united states and canada     the depreciation   or weakening   of one country   the us dollar for this example   indicates the appreciation   or strengthening   of the other currency   which in this example is the canadian dollar    	1
   source   federal reserve economic data   fred        <link>        <link>   the bottom graph shows the exchange rate from us dollars to canadian dollars since <num>  	0
 this example shows how  stronger euro discourages exports by the french firm   because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country  	0
 from the point of view of the us economy   the example also shows how  weaker us dollar encourages exports  	0
 exchange rates would bounce around less   too  	0
 the economist milton friedman   <num> <num>     for example   wrote  defense of floating exchange rates in <num> in his book capitalism and freedom   being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates  	0
 when we support  free price system   for goods and services   at home   this does not imply that we favor  system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down  	0
 the brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways  	0
 one approach is to use an expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates  	0
 in foreign exchange markets   the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation  	0
 when  country decides to alter the market exchange rate   it faces  number of tradeoffs  	0
 if it uses monetary policy to alter the exchange rate   it then can not at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession  	0
 if it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates   then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency  	0
 if  central bank ends up in  situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets   it will be buying the currency of other countries   like us dollars or euros   to hold as reserves  	0
 holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost   and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit  	0
 taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as tobin taxes   named after james tobin   the <num> nobel laureate in economics who proposed such  tax in  <num> lecture  	1
 for example    government might tax all foreign exchange transactions   or attempt to tax short   term portfolio investment while exempting long   term foreign direct investment  	0
 countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from  country  	0
 the choice depends both on how well  nation   central bank can implement  specific exchange rate policy and on how well  nation   firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies  	0
  national economy that does  fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth   low inflation   low unemployment   and  sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy   conversely   no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals  	0
 on the other hand    merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems   such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies  	0
 government spending covers  range of services provided by the federal   state   and local governments  	0
 when the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in  given year   it runs  budget deficit  	1
 conversely   when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in  year   it runs  budget surplus  	1
 taxes also vary with marital status   family size   and other factors  	0
 the marginal tax rates   the tax that must be paid on all yearly income   for  single taxpayer range from <num>   to <num>     depending on income   as the following clear it up feature explains  	1
 the third   largest source of federal tax revenue   as shown in <link> is the corporate income tax  	0
 the common name for corporate income is   profits   over time   corporate income tax receipts have declined as  share of gdp   from about <num>   in the <num> to an average of <num>   to <num>   of gdp in the first decade of the <num>  	0
 having discussed the revenue   taxes   and expense   spending   side of the budget   we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus   which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over  fiscal year   which starts october <num> and ends september <num> of the next year  	0
 even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates   fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected  	0
 this is referred to as crowding out   where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates   which reduces business investment and household consumption  	1
 finally   once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs  	0
 the time to get the projects started is often called the implementation lag  	1
 at this point   you may wonder about the federal reserve  	0
 after all   can the federal reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates   or in this case   to prevent interest rates from rising  	0
 other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the  <num> education system  	0
 programs for early childhood education   like the federal head start program   are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources  	0
 government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges  	0
 if the funding for  larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors   then  budget deficit may be accompanied by  trade deficit  	0
 in some countries   this pattern of  twin deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to  country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause  depreciation of the exchange rate and  financial crisis as well  	0
 it depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors  	0
 the differences in economic statistics and other measures of well   being   substantial though they are   do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries  	0
 aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth   four additional determinants are significant in  wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning   geography   demography   industrial structure   and institutions  	0
 geographic and demographic differences	0
 this combination of technology   human capital   and physical capital   combined with the incentives of  market   oriented economic context   proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth  	0
 challenges faced by these middle   income countries are  legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time  	0
 unemployment rates in the nations of europe have typically been higher than in the united states  	0
 in <num>   before the start of the great recession   the us unemployment rate was <num>     compared with <num>   in france   <num>   in germany   and <num>   in sweden  	0
 the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in europe   which dates back to the <num>   is typically attributed to the fact that european economies have  higher natural rate of unemployment because they have  greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs  	0
 addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice  	0
 the economies of europe thrive with high levels of trade  	0
 in the north american free trade agreement   nafta     the united states   canada   and mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers  	1
 many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy  	0
 in order for  trade deficit to take place   foreign countries must provide loans or investments   which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually   that the deficit will become  surplus    	0
  trade surplus   you may remember   exists when  nation   exports exceed its imports  	1
 so   in order for  trade deficit to switch to  trade surplus    nation   exports must rise and its imports must fall  	0
 recall from the chapter choice in  world of scarcity that  country has  comparative advantage when  good can be produced at  lower cost in terms of other goods  	1
 the question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this     what do we give up to produce this good    	0
 it should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from choice in  world of scarcity  	0
 for example   if zambia focuses its resources on producing copper   its labor   land and financial resources can not be used to produce other goods such as corn  	0
 given their current production levels   if the united states can trade an amount of corn fewer than <num> bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than <num> barrels   it will gain from trade  	0
 with trade   the united states can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade  	0
   recall that the chapter	0
 if mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade   it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production  	0
 if mexico   instead   produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the united states   where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower   mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the united states  	0
 conversely   when the united states specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in mexico   international trade allows the united states to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in mexico  	0
 traditionally   tariffs were used simply as  political tool to protect certain vested economic   social   and cultural interests  	0
 the world trade organization   wto   is committed to lowering barriers to trade  	0
 the world   nations meet through the wto to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade   such as tariffs  	0
 they make imports more expensive for consumers   discouraging imports  	0
 for example   in recent years large   flat   screen televisions imported from china have faced  <num>   tariff rate another way to control trade is through import quotas   which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that can be imported  	1

 in brazil   without trade   the equilibrium price of sugar is <num> cents per pound and the equilibrium output is <num> tons  	0
 now   let   look at what happens with protectionism  	0
 us sugar farmers are likely to argue that   if only they could be protected from sugar imported from brazil   the united states would have higher domestic sugar production   more jobs in the sugar industry   and american sugar farmers would receive  higher price  	0
 while the united states economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates   according to the bureau of labor statistics   from spring <num> to late <num>   the unemployment rate rose from <num>   to <num>     it has since fallen back to <num>   in spring <num>   the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time  	0
 the number of us jobs rose from <num> million in <num> to <num> million in <num>  	0
 protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but   for two reasons   it costs jobs in other unprotected industries  	0
 first   if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry   they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries   and so jobs are lost in those other industries  	0
 one concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high   skilled   high   wage workers in the united states   it may also impose costs on low   skilled   low   wage workers  	0
 after all   high   skilled us workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers   machinery   and pharmaceuticals in which the united states has  comparative advantage  	0
 meanwhile   low   skilled us workers must now compete against extremely low   wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing  	0
 dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production  	1
 anti   dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production  	1
 if free trade meant the destruction of life itself   then even economists would convert to protectionism  	0
 while globalization   and economic activity of all kinds   can pose environmental dangers   it seems quite possible that   with the appropriate safeguards in place   the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized  	0
 the race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this  	0
 profit   seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards   thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits  	0
 the united nations was unable to agree to this  	0
 instead   the general agreement on tariffs and trade   gatt     was established in <num> to provide  forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade  	1
 in <num>   the gatt was transformed into the wto  	0
 for the united states   perhaps the best   known regional trading agreement is the north american free trade agreement   nafta    	0
 the united states also participates in some less   prominent regional trading agreements   like the caribbean basin initiative   which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries   and  free trade agreement with israel  	1
 what is  function  	0
  function describes  relationship  	1
 sometimes the relationship is  definition  	0
 the concept of slope is very useful in economics   because it measures the relationship between two variables  	1
  positive slope means that two variables are positively related   that is   when  increases   so does    or when  decreases    decreases also  	1
 graphically    positive slope means that as  line on the line graph moves from left to right   the line rises  	0
 the graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs   because they show  relationship between two variables   one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis  	1
  pie graph   sometimes called  pie chart   is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts  	1
  circle represents  group as  whole  	0
 this appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences   called indifference curves   which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility  	1
 by setting aside the assumption of putting  numerical valuation on utility   an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic   the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model what is an indifference curve  	0
 from this starting point   her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low   while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high   so on the margin   it will take  relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book  	0
 in short   the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution   that is   the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant   also changes   as  result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods  	1
 anyone who faces  change in price will experience two interlinked motivations    substitution effect and an income effect  	0
 the substitution effect is that when  good becomes more expensive   people seek out substitutes  	1
 if oranges become more expensive   fruit   lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples   grapefruit   or raisins  	0
 the substitution effect tells how petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen   so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive   but if she had remained at the same level of utility  	0
 the slope of the budget constraint in  labor   leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate  	0
 thus   the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set   reflecting the labor   leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate   but tangent to the original indifference curve   showing the same level of utility or   buying power  	0
 the shift from original choice  to point    which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line   shows that because of the higher wage   petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income  	0
 the expenditure   output model   sometimes also called the keynesian cross diagram   determines the equilibrium level of real gdp by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced  	1
 the axes of the keynesian cross diagram presented in <link> show real gdp on the horizontal axis as  measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as  measure of spending  	0
 when the macroeconomy is in equilibrium   it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real gdp   because by definition   gdp is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy  	1
 thus   the equilibrium calculated with  keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal   which will only occur along the <num> degree line  	0
 the marginal propensity to consume   mpc     is the share of the additional dollar of income  person decides to devote to consumption expenditures  	1
 the marginal propensity to save   mps   is the share of the additional dollar  person decides to save  	1
 it must always hold true that  	0
 imports are drawn in the keynesian cross diagram as  downward   sloping line   with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import   mpi     out of national income  	0
 in <link>        the marginal propensity to import is <num>  	0
 the aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function   after taxes     the investment function   the government spending function   the export function   and the import function  	1
 the point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment   government   and export expenditures   which do not vary with national income  	0
 conversely   <link>      shows  situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule   <chem>   intersects the <num> degree line above potential gdp  	0
 the gap between the level of real gdp at the equilibrium <chem> and potential gdp is called an inflationary gap  	1
 the inflationary gap also requires  bit of interpreting  	0
 the familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency  	0
 one typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing  cost on another  	1
 conversely   if  situation is inefficient   it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning   the economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved  	1
 those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at   <num>   but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of   <num>   clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product  	0
 the amount that  seller is paid for  good minus the seller   actual cost is called producer surplus  	1
 in <link>   producer surplus is the area labeled    that is   the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium  	0
 the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus   also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus  	1
 in  very real sense   it is like money thrown away that benefits no one  	0
 in <link>        the deadweight loss is the area      	0
 when deadweight loss exists   it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher   in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make  	0
  second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers  	0
 in short   collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution  	1
 there are three primary forms of collective behavior   the crowd   the mass   and the public  	0
 it takes  fairly large number of people in close proximity to form  crowd   lofland <num>    	0
 examples include  group of people attending an ani difranco concert   tailgating at  patriots game   or attending  worship service  	0
 conventional crowds are those who come together for  scheduled event that occurs regularly   like  religious service  	1
 expressive crowds are people who join together to express emotion   often at funerals   weddings   or the like  	1
 the final type   acting crowds   focuses on  specific goal or action   such as  protest movement or riot in addition to the different types of crowds   collective groups can also be identified in two other ways  	1
 sociologist david aberle   <num>   addresses this question by developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want to change and how much change they want  	0
 reform movements seek to change something specific about the social structure  	1
 examples include antinuclear groups   mothers against drunk driving   madd     the dreamers movement for immigration reform   and the human rights campaign   advocacy for marriage equality  	0
 resource mobilization and the civil rights movementan example of resource mobilization theory is activity of the civil rights movement in the decade between the mid <num> and the mid <num>  	0
 social movements had existed before   notably the women   suffrage movement and  long line of labor movements   thus constituting an existing social movement sector   which is the multiple social movement industries in  society   even if they have widely varying constituents and goals  	0
 the civil rights movement had also existed well before rosa parks refused to give up her bus seat to  white man  	0
 the anti   gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between  man and  woman  	1
 prognostic framing   the second type   offers  solution and states how it will be implemented  	1
 some examples of this frame   when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti   gay marriage movement   include the plan to restrict marriage to   one man   one woman   or to allow only   civil unions   instead of marriages  	0
 new social movement theory    development of european social scientists in the <num> and <num>   attempts to explain the proliferation of postindustrial and postmodern movements that are difficult to analyze using traditional social movement theories  	1
 rather than being one specific theory   it is more of  perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics   identity   culture   and social change  	0
 modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to  developed   technologically driven society   irwin <num>    	1
 by this definition   the level of modernity within  society is judged by the sophistication of its technology   particularly as it relates to infrastructure   industry   and the like  	0
 sociologists study all aspects and levels of society  	1
 sociologists working from the micro   level study small groups and individual interactions   while those using macro   level analysis look at trends among and between large groups and societies  	0
 for example    micro   level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals  	0
 remember   though   that culture is  product of the people in  society   sociologists take care not to treat the concept of   culture   as though it were alive in its own right  	1
 reification is an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has  real   material existence   sahn <num>    	1
 in seeking verstehen   outside observers of  social world   an entire culture or  small setting   attempt to understand it from an insider   point of view in his book the nature of social action   <num>     weber described sociology as striving to 	1
 he and other like   minded sociologists proposed  philosophy of antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes   cultural norms   and societal values  	1
 this approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict   traditional in science     but to systematically gain an in   depth understanding of social worlds  	0
 sociologists study social events   interactions   and patterns   and they develop  theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do  	1
 in sociology    theory is  way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create  testable proposition   called  hypothesis   about society   allan <num>    	1

 classic sociological theories are still considered important and current   but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them   calhoun <num>    	0
 in sociology    few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life   and these are called paradigms  	1
 paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within  discipline to formulate theories   generalizations   and the experiments performed in support of them  	0
 three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking   because they provide useful explanations   structural functionalism   conflict theory   and symbolic interactionism  	0
 he believed that to study society    sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws   morals   values   religious beliefs   customs   fashion   and rituals   which all serve to govern social life  	0
 alfred radcliffe   brown   <num>   <num>   defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as  whole   and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity   radcliffe   brown <num>    	0
 in  healthy society   all parts work together to maintain stability    state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as parsons   <num>    	1
 another noted structural functionalist   robert merton   <num>   <num>     pointed out that social processes often have many functions  	0
 manifest functions are the consequences of  social process that are sought or anticipated   while latent functions are the unsought consequences of  social process  	1
  manifest function of college education   for example   includes gaining knowledge   preparing for  career   and finding  good job that utilizes that education  	0
 conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability  	0
 many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest  	0
 symbolic interactionist theory	0
 symbolic interactionism is  micro   level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within  society  	1
 communication   the exchange of meaning through language and symbols   is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds  	1
 sociological research attempts to answer  vast variety of questions   such as these and more   about our social world we often have opinions about social situations   but these may be biased by our expectations or based on limited data  	0
 instead   scientific research is based on empirical evidence   which is evidence that comes from direct experience   scientifically gathered data   or experimentation  	1

 many people believe   for example   that crime rates go up when there    full moon   but research does   support this opinion  	0
  hypothesis is  testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables   it    possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in many instances   as well as among various groups or in different places  	1
 sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method   or an interpretative framework   to increase understanding of societies and social interactions   but research begins with the search for an answer to  question  	0
 sociologists do not rule out any topic   but would strive to frame these questions in better research terms  	0
 that is why sociologists are careful to define their terms  	0
 in  hygiene study   for instance   hygiene could be defined as   personal habits to maintain physical appearance   as opposed to health       and  researcher might ask     how do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance    	1
 when forming these basic research questions   sociologists develop an operational definition   that is   they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it  	1
 the operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept  	0
 in sociology   the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another  	0
 in research   independent variables are the cause of the change  	1
 the dependent variable is the effect   or thing that is changed  	1
  researcher would   stroll into  crime   ridden neighborhood at midnight   calling out     any gang members around    	0
 and if  researcher walked into  coffee shop and told the employees they would be observed as part of  study on work efficiency   the self   conscious   intimidated baristas might not behave naturally  	0
 this is called the hawthorne effect   where people change their behavior because they know they are being watched as part of  study  	1

  survey targets  specific population   people who are the focus of  study   such as college athletes   international students   or teenagers living with type <num>   juvenile   onset   diabetes  	1
 most researchers choose to survey  small sector of the population   or  sample   that is    manageable number of subjects who represent  larger population  	1
 for some topics   the researcher might ask yes   or   no or multiple   choice questions   allowing subjects to choose possible responses to each question  	0
 this kind of quantitative data   research collected in numerical form that can be counted   are easy to tabulate  	1
 just count up the number of   yes   and   no   responses or correct answers   and chart them into percentages  	0
 questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers   beyond   yes       no     or the option next to  checkbox  	0
 they meet subjects where they live   work   and play  	0
 field research refers to gathering primary data from  natural environment without doing  lab experiment or  survey  	1
 it is  research method suited to an interpretive framework rather than to the scientific method  	0
 ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire social setting  	1
 ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community  	0
 while sociologists often engage in original research studies   they also contribute knowledge to the discipline through secondary data analysis  	0
 secondary data does   result from firsthand research collected from primary sources   but are the already completed work of other researchers  	1

 in everyday conversation   people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society   but the terms have slightly different meanings   and the distinction is important to  sociologist  	0
  society describes  group of people who share  community and  culture  	1
 by   community     sociologists refer to  definable region   as small as  neighborhood   brooklyn   or   the east side of town       as large as  country   ethiopia   the united states   or nepal     or somewhere in between   in the united states   this might include someone who identifies with southern or midwestern society    	1

 people sanction certain behaviors by giving their support   approval   or permission   or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and nonsupport  	0
 sanctions are  form of social control    way to encourage conformity to cultural norms  	1
 sometimes people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions   good grades   for instance   may mean praise from parents and teachers  	0
 there are plenty of formal norms   but the list of informal norms   casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to   is longer  	1
 people learn informal norms by observation   imitation   and general socialization  	0

 people often associate high culture with intellectualism   political power   and prestige  	0
 sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures   which are  type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture   norms and values  	1
 in contrast to subcultures   which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society   countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by   sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society  	0

 this type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and  low division of labor created shared morals and values among people   such as hunter   gatherer groups  	0
 when people tend to do the same type of work   durkheim argued   they tend to think and act alike  	0
 in industrial societies   mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity   which is social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences  	1
 in capitalist societies   durkheim wrote   division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things  	0

 and such  district exists in the heart of the second city of england   the first manufacturing city of the world  	0
 add to that the long hours   the use of child labor   and exposure to extreme conditions of heat   cold   and toxic chemicals   and it is no wonder that marx and engels referred to capitalism   which is  way of organizing an economy so that the things that are used to make and transport products   such as land   oil   factories   ships   etc  	1

 in order for society to overcome false consciousness   marx proposed that it be replaced with class consciousness   the awareness of one   rank in society  	1
 instead of existing as    class in itself     the proletariat must become    class for itself   in order to produce social change   marx and engels <num>     meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society   the class could become an advocate for social improvements  	1
 in <num> sociologists peter berger and thomas luckmann wrote  book called the social construction of reality  	0
 in it   they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction   which they call habitualization  	0
 habitualization describes how   any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into  pattern   which can then be   performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort     berger and luckmann <num>    	1
 that is   people   behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality  	0
 for example    teenager who is repeatedly given  label   overachiever   player   bum   might live up to the term even though it initially was    part of his character like berger and luckmann in their description of habitualization   thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by   successive definitions of the situation  	0

 sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits that  person experiences according to their rank and role in society  	1
 some statuses are ascribed   those you do not select   such as son   elderly person   or female  	1
 others   called achieved statuses   are obtained by choice   such as  high school dropout   self   made millionaire   or nurse  	1

 successful social movements use three kinds of frames   snow and benford <num>   to further their goals  	0
 the first type   diagnostic framing   states the problem in  clear   easily understood way  	1
 when applying diagnostic frames   there are no shades of gray   instead   there is the belief that what   they   do is wrong and this is how   we   will fix it  	0

 durkheim believed that individuals may make up society   but in order to study society   sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts  	0
 social facts are the laws   morals   values   religious beliefs   customs   fashions   rituals   and all of the cultural rules that govern social life   durkheim <num>    	1
 each of these social facts serves one or more functions within  society  	0
 conflict theory	0

 rothman had conducted  form of study called participant observation   in which researchers join people and participate in  group   routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that context  	1
 this method lets researchers experience  specific aspect of social life  	0
 one way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment   meaning they investigate relationships to test  hypothesis    scientific approach  	1
  researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records  	0
 to guide the search through  vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources   sociologists employ content analysis   applying  systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as they relate to the study at hand  	1

 both informal and formal education include cultural transmission  	0
 another role of schools   according to functionalist theory   is that of sorting   or classifying students based on academic merit or potential  	0
 the most capable students are identified early in schools through testing and classroom achievements  	0
 this hidden curriculum reinforces the positions of those with higher cultural capital and serves to bestow status unequally  	0
 conflict theorists point to tracking    formalized sorting system that places students on   tracks     advanced versus low achievers   that perpetuate inequalities  	1
 while educators may believe that students do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to more individual attention from teachers   conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self   fulfilling prophecies in which students live up   or down   to teacher and societal expectations   education week <num>    	0
 the findings in the coleman report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to education in the united states  	0
 the federal head start program   which is still active and successful today   was developed to give low   income students an opportunity to make up the preschool deficit discussed in coleman   findings  	0
 the program provides academic   centered preschool to students of low socioeconomic status  	1
 government leaders might have this kind of influence as well   but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government  	0
 as this example indicates   there is more than one type of authority in  community authority refers to accepted power   that is   power that people agree to follow  	1
 people listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect  	0
 followers accept the power of charismatic authority because they are drawn to the leader   personal qualities  	0
 the appeal of  charismatic leader can be extraordinary   and can inspire followers to make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution  	0
 the power held by these positions varies from one country to another  	0
 strictly speaking    monarchy is  government in which  single person    monarch   rules until he or she dies or abdicates the throne  	1
 usually    monarch claims the rights to the title by way of hereditary succession or as  result of some sort of divine appointment or calling  	0
 the power in an oligarchy is held by  small   elite group  	1
 unlike in  monarchy   members of an oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their statuses based on ties to noble ancestry  	0
  democracy is  form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice   or vote   in determining state policy   regardless of their level of socioeconomic status  	1
 another important fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of  just and comprehensive constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike  	0

 turner and killian   <num>   identified four types of crowds  	0
 casual crowds consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who are   really interacting   such as people standing in line at the post office  	1
 conventional crowds are those who come together for  scheduled event that occurs regularly   like  religious service  	1
 they emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior   especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors  	0
 emergent norm theory asserts that   in this circumstance   people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular   individual   set of norms   which may change as the crowd experience evolves  	1
 this focus on the individual component of interaction reflects  symbolic interactionist perspective for turner and killian   the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in  new situation   or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar  	0
 social movements are purposeful   organized groups that strive to work toward  common social goal  	1
 while most of us learned about social movements in history classes   we tend to take for granted the fundamental changes they caused   and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global social movements  	0
 examples include antinuclear groups   mothers against drunk driving   madd     the dreamers movement for immigration reform   and the human rights campaign   advocacy for marriage equality  	0
 revolutionary movements seek to completely change every aspect of society  	1

 churches and their ministers joined the struggle   and the protest organization in friendship was formed as well as the friendly club and the club from nowhere  	0
  social movement industry   which is the collection of the social movement organizations that are striving toward similar goals   was growing  	1
 martin luther king jremerged during these events to become the charismatic leader of the movement   gained respect from elites in the federal government   and aided by even more emerging smos such as the student non   violent coordinating committee   sncc     the congress of racial equality   core     the national association for the advancement of colored people   naacp     and the southern christian leadership conference   sclc     among others  	0
 several still exist today  	0
 as you can see   there may be many competing prognostic frames even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames  	0
 finally   motivational framing is the call to action   what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the prognostic frame  	1
 these frames are action   oriented  	0
 collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change   which is the change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts or technological innovations  	0
 essentially   any disruptive shift in the status quo   be it intentional or random   human   caused or natural   can lead to social change  	0
 sociology is the study of groups and group interactions   societies and social interactions   from small and personal groups to very large groups  	1
  group of people who live in  defined geographic area   who interact with one another   and who share  common culture is what sociologists call  society  	1
 the term culture refers to the group   shared practices   values   and beliefs  	1
 culture encompasses  group   way of life   from routine   everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members   lives  	0
 some sociologists study social facts   which are the laws   morals   values   religious beliefs   customs   fashions   rituals   and all of the cultural rules that govern social life   that may contribute to these changes in the family  	1
 do people in the united states view marriage and family differently than before  	0
 he argued that how an individual comes to view himself or herself is based to  very large extent on interactions with others  	0
 mead called specific individuals that impacted  person   life significant others   and he also conceptualized   generalized others   as the organized and generalized attitude of  social group  	1
 mead   work is closely associated with the symbolic interactionist approach and emphasizes the micro   level of analysis  	0
 the different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology  	0
 quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants  	1
 researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior  	0
 for example   although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon    mile durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it  	0
 his studied social ties within  group   or social solidarity   and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion   based differences  	1
 durkheim gathered  large amount of data about europeans who had ended their lives   and he did indeed find differences based on religion  	0
 functionalism   also called structural   functional theory   sees society as  structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society  	1
 functionalism grew out of the writings of english philosopher and biologist   hebert spencer   <num> <num>     who saw similarities between society and the human body   he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning   the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning   spencer <num>    	0
 alfred radcliffe   brown   <num> <num>   defined the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as  whole   and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity   radcliffe   brown <num>    	0
 in  healthy society   all parts work together to maintain stability    state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as parsons   <num>    	1
 latent functions can be beneficial   neutral   or harmful  	0
 social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions  	1
 in education   examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades   truancy   dropping out   not graduating   and not finding suitable employment  	0
 for example   while  conflict theorist studying  political protest might focus on class difference    symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact   as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message  	0
 the focus on the importance of symbols in building  society led sociologists like erving goffman   <num>   <num>   to develop  technique called dramaturgical analysis  	0
 goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people   interactions showed patterns of cultural   scripts   because it can be unclear what part  person may play in  given situation   he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds   goffman <num>    	1
 studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods   such as in   depth interviews or participant observation   because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live  	0
 many people believe   for example   that crime rates go up when there    full moon   but research does   support this opinion  	0
 researchers rotton and kelly   <num>   conducted  meta   analysis of research on the full moon   effects on behavior  	0
 meta   analysis is  technique in which the results of virtually all previous studies on  specific subject are evaluated together  	1
 in this field   results of studies tend to provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before   knowledge of other cultures   knowledge of rituals and beliefs   or knowledge of trends and attitudes  	0
 no matter what research approach they use   researchers want to maximize the study   reliability   which refers to how likely research results are to be replicated if the study is reproduced  	1
 reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one person will happen to all people in  group  	0
 the next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through  literature review   which is  review of any existing similar or related studies  	0
  visit to the library and  thorough online search will uncover existing research about the topic of study  	0
 in research   independent variables are the cause of the change  	1
 the dependent variable is the effect   or thing that is changed  	1
 researchers choose methods that best suit their study topics and that fit with their overall approaches to research  	0
 in planning studies   designs   sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of social investigation   survey   field research   experiment   and secondary data analysis   or use of existing sources  	0
 every research method comes with plusses and minuses   and the topic of study strongly influences which method or methods are put to use  	0
 surveys	0
  survey targets  specific population   people who are the focus of  study   such as college athletes   international students   or teenagers living with type <num>   juvenile   onset   diabetes  	0
 most researchers choose to survey  small sector of the population   or  sample   that is    manageable number of subjects who represent  larger population  	1
 the success of  study depends on how well  population is represented by the sample  	0
 people are more likely to share honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously  	0
 this type of information is qualitative data   results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in  natural setting  	1
 qualitative information is harder to organize and tabulate  	0
 much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation  	0
 and while field research looks for correlation   its small sample size does not allow for establishing  causal relationship between two variables  	0
 sometimes  researcher wants to study one specific person or event  	0
  case study is an in   depth analysis of  single event   situation   or individual  	1
 to conduct  case study    researcher examines existing sources like documents and archival records   conducts interviews   engages in direct observation and even participant observation   if possible researchers might use this method to study  single case of   for example    foster child   drug lord   cancer patient   criminal   or rape victim  	0
 one of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive research   or unobtrusive research     meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people   behaviors  	1
 unlike studies requiring direct contact with people   using previously published data does   require entering  population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process  	0
 while he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values   he declared it was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses  	0
 sociologists   he stated   must establish value neutrality    practice of remaining impartial   without bias or judgment   during the course of  study and in publishing results   <num>    	1
 sociologists are obligated to disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data  	0
 nonmaterial culture   in contrast   consists of the ideas   attitudes   and beliefs of  society  	1
 material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked   and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas  	0
 the first   and perhaps most crucial   elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs  	0
 values are  culture   standard for discerning what is good and just in society  	1
 values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching  culture   beliefs  	0
 values portray an ideal culture   the standards society would like to embrace and live up to  	1
 but ideal culture differs from real culture   the way society actually is   based on what occurs and exists  	1
 in an ideal culture   there would be no traffic accidents   murders   poverty   or racial tension  	0
 these examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured   or what sociologists call norms  	1
 norms define how to behave in accordance with what  society has defined as good   right   and important   and most members of the society adhere to them  	0
 breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live by norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways  	0
 mores   mor   ays   are norms that embody the moral views and principles of  group  	1
 violating them can have serious consequences  	0
 while different cultures have varying systems of symbols   one symbol is common to all   language  	0

 popular culture events might include  parade    baseball game   or the season finale of  television show  	0
 an innovation refers to an object or concept   initial appearance in society   it   innovative because it is markedly new  	1
 there are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea   discover it or invent it  	0
 material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture   technology can spread through society in  matter of months   but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change  	0
 sociologist william fogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of  new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture   ogburn <num>    	1
 culture lag can also cause tangible problems  	0
 exactly what is  society  	0
 in sociological terms   society refers to  group of people who live in  definable community and share the same culture  	1

 previously   the depletion of  region   crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their livestock  	0
 horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to grow stable crops  	0
 they were similar to hunter   gatherers in that they largely depended on the environment for survival   but since they did   have to abandon their location to follow resources   they were able to start permanent settlements  	0
 postindustrial societyinformation societies   sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies   are  recent development  	0
 unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods   information societies are based on the production of information and services  	1
 in his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways   he wrote     if  do not submit to the conventions of society   if in my dress  do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class   the ridicule  provoke   the social isolation in which  am kept   produce   although in an attenuated form   the same effects as punishment     durkheim <num>    	0
 durkheim also believed that social integration   or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups   was  key factor in social life  	1
 following the ideas of comte and spencer   durkheim likened society to  living organism   in which each organ plays  necessary role in keeping the being alive  	0
 even the socially deviant members of society are necessary   durkheim argued   as punishments for deviance affirm established cultural values and norms  	0
 laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge  	0
 while the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is   in the long run   advantageous for  society   durkheim noted that it can be  time of chaos and   normlessness  	0
 one of the outcomes of the transition is something he called social anomie  	0
 anomie   literally     without law     is  situation in which society no longer has the support of  firm collective consciousness  	1

 weber   analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization  	0
  rational society is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition  	1
 in  sense   it exists by consensus   both prior and current  	0
 this is an example of the process of institutionalization   the act of implanting  convention or norm into society  	1
 bear in mind that the institution   while socially constructed   is still quite real  	0
 roles and statusas you can imagine   people employ many types of behaviors in day   to   day life  	0
 roles are patterns of behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of  person   social status  	1
 currently   while reading this text   you are playing the role of  student  	0
 some statuses are ascribed   those you do not select   such as son   elderly person   or female  	1
 others   called achieved statuses   are obtained by choice   such as  high school dropout   self   made millionaire   or nurse  	1

 in the <num>   as the urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved   suburbs developed  	0
 suburbs are the communities surrounding cities   typically close enough for  daily commute in   but far enough away to allow for more space than city living affords  	1
 the bucolic suburban landscape of the early twentieth century has largely disappeared due to sprawl  	0
 together   the suburbs   exurbs   and metropolitan areas all combine to form  metropolis  	0
 new york was the first us megalopolis    huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding suburbs  	1
 these metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are  growing part of the us landscape the suburban sprawl in toronto means long commutes and traffic congestion  	0
 the world   most densely populated cities are now largely concentrated in the global south    marked change from several decades ago when the biggest cities were found in the global north  	0
 in the next forty years   the biggest global challenge for urbanized populations   particularly in less developed countries   will be to achieve development that occurs without depleting or damaging the natural environment   also called sustainable development   united nations   department of economic and social affairs   population division <num>    	1
 the subfield of environmental sociology studies the way humans interact with their environments  	1
 this field is closely related to human ecology   which focuses on the relationship between people and their built and natural environment  	1
 and it is far more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the environment  	0
    waste is the name for obsolete   broken   and worn   out electronics   from computers to mobile phones to televisions  	1
 the challenge is that these products   which are multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence   the designing of products to quickly become outdated and then be replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper electronics     have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them   which makes for  dangerous combination  	1

 another example of  nongroup is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way  	1
 these people are considered  category   and as an example all children born from approximately <num> <num> are referred to as   millennials  	1
 why are millennials  category and not  group  	0
 because while some of them may share  sense of identity   they do not   as  whole   interact frequently with each other interestingly   people within an aggregate or category can become  group  	0
 they may also be task   focused and time   limited  	0
 these groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one   meaning that their role is more goal  or task   oriented than emotional  	0
  classroom or office can be an example of  secondary group  	0
  small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction   such as  nuclear family    dyad   or  triad  	1
 georg simmel   <num>   <num>   wrote extensively about the difference between  dyad   or two   member group   and  triad   which is  three   member group   simmel <num>    	1
 in the former   if one person withdraws   the group can no longer exist  	0
  further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching  solution  	0
 in contrast    laissez   faire leader   french for   leave it alone     is hands   off   allowing group members to self   manage and make their own decisions  	1
 an example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard   leaves materials on the shelves   and tells students to help themselves and make some art  	0

 people often complain about bureaucracies    declaring them slow   rule   bound   difficult to navigate   and unfriendly  	0
 let   take  look at terms that define  bureaucracy to understand what they mean hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another   who in turn must answer to her own superiors  	1
 for example   as an employee at walmart   your shift manager assigns you tasks  	0
 finally   bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality   which takes personal feelings out of professional situations  	1

 sociologist robert merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of  functioning society   but he expanded on durkheim   ideas by developing strain theory   which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays  part in determining whether  person conforms or deviates  	1
 from birth   we  re encouraged to achieve the   american dream   of financial success  	0
 conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance  	1
 unlike functionalists   conflict theorists do   see these factors as positive functions of society  	0
 those who do   however   have often been labeled   deviant   by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves  	0
 labeling theory examines the ascribing of  deviant behavior to another person by members of society  	1
 thus   what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them   but by the reactions of others to these behaviors  	0

 theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system   as with most other social problems   are rooted in capitalist society  	0
 according to conflict theorists   capitalism and the pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health   the changing of something not generally thought of as  commodity into something that can be bought and sold in  marketplace  	0

 the most significant contributions of locke    seventeenth   century english philosopher   were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights   which were believed to be god   given rights to life   liberty   and property  	0
 so committed were the british to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century   parliament removed king james ii   already disliked because he was roman catholic   in the glorious revolution and invited his protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation  	0

 the first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the stamp act   passed in <num>   which required that almost all paper goods   such as diplomas   land deeds   contracts   and newspapers   have revenue stamps placed on them  	1
 the outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn   but its repeal was soon followed by  series of other tax acts   such as the townshend acts   <num>     which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass   tea   and paint  	0

 these acts virtually abolished town meetings in massachusetts and otherwise interfered with the colony   ability to govern itself  	0
 this assault on massachusetts and its economy enraged people throughout the colonies   and delegates from all the colonies except georgia formed the first continental congress to create  unified opposition to great britain  	0
 among other things   members of the institution developed  declaration of rights and grievances  	0
 congress drafted  declaration of causes explaining the colonies   reasons for rebellion  	0

 thus   powers given to the central government were severely limited  	0
 the confederation congress   formerly the continental congress   had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and indian tribes   declare war   coin currency and borrow money   and settle disputes between states  	1
 each state legislature appointed delegates to the congress   these men could be recalled at any time  	0
 the weaknesses of the articles of confederation   already recognized by many   became apparent to all as  result of an uprising of massachusetts farmers   led by daniel shays  	1
 known as shays   rebellion   the incident panicked the governor of massachusetts   who called upon the national government for assistance  	0
 however   with no power to raise an army   the government had no troops at its disposal  	0
 all the states except rhode island chose delegates to send to the meeting    total of seventy men in all   but many did not attend  	0
 among those not in attendance were john adams and thomas jefferson   both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats  	0
 because the shortcomings of the articles of confederation proved impossible to overcome   the convention that met in philadelphia in <num> decided to create an entirely new government  	0
 one of the first differences among the delegates to become clear was between those from large states   such as new york and virginia   and those who represented small states   like delaware  	0
 when discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution   the delegates from virginia called for  bicameral legislature consisting of two houses  	1
 the number of  state   representatives in each house was to be based on the state   population  	0
 after debating at length over whether the virginia plan or the new jersey plan provided the best model for the nation   legislature   the framers of the constitution had ultimately arrived at what is called the great compromise   suggested by roger sherman of connecticut  	0
 congress   it was decided   would consist of two chambers   the senate and the house of representatives  	1
 the framers resolved this problem through  separation of powers   dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one   as shown in <link>  	0
 they also created  system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others   thus requiring them to work together  	0

 some did not support it   but the majority did  	0
 other delegates   such as edmund randolph of virginia   disapproved of the constitution because it created  new federal judicial system  	0
 their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived  	0
 opponents of ratification were called anti   federalists  	1
 anti   federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures   with which they had more contact   could better protect their freedoms  	0
 the approval of new york was the last major hurdle  	0
 facing considerable opposition to the constitution in that state   alexander hamilton   james madison   and john jay wrote  series of essays   beginning in <num>   arguing for  strong federal government and support of the constitution <link>  	1
 later compiled as the federalist and now known as the federalist papers   these eighty   five essays were originally published in newspapers in new york and other states under the name of publius    supporter of the roman republic  	0
 indeed   hamilton asked rhetorically   would american citizens best be served by  representative   whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and his acquaintances   or by someone with more extensive knowledge of the world  	0
 to those who argued that  merchant and land   owning elite would come to dominate congress   hamilton countered that the majority of men currently sitting in new york   state senate and assembly were landowners of moderate wealth and that artisans usually chose merchants     their natural patron      and friend          to represent them  	0

 the bill of rights was intended to quiet the fears of anti   federalists that the constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government  	0
 many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights  	0
 for example   the right to bear arms for protection   second amendment     the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime   third amendment     the right to  trial by jury   sixth and seventh amendments     and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment   eighth amendment   are taken from the english bill of rights  	1
 the fifth amendment   which requires among other things that people can not be deprived of their life   liberty   or property except by  legal proceeding   was also greatly influenced by english law as well as the protections granted to virginians in the virginia declaration of rights  	1
 the ninth and tenth amendments were intended to provide yet another assurance that people   rights would be protected and that the federal government would not become too powerful  	0
 the ninth amendment guarantees that liberties extend beyond those described in the preceding documents  	1
 this was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive   and the government should not attempt to interfere with them  	0
 for example   the seventeenth amendment   ratified in <num>   gave voters the right to directly elect us senators  	1

 specifically   the federal design spelled out in the constitution divides powers between two levels of government   the states and the federal government   and creates  mechanism for them to check and balance one another  	0
 as an institutional design   federalism both safeguards state interests and creates  strong union led by  capable central government  	1
 the main advantage of this supermajority requirement is that no changes to the constitution can occur unless there is broad support within congress and among states  	0
 the potential drawback is that numerous national amendment initiatives   such as the equal rights amendment   era     which aims to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex   have failed because they can not garner sufficient consent among members of congress or   in the case of the era   the states  	0
 before the late <num>   the united kingdom   unitary system was centralized to the extent that the national government held the most important levers of power  	0
 since then   power has been gradually decentralized through  process of devolution   leading to the creation of regional governments in scotland   wales   and northern ireland as well as the delegation of specific responsibilities to them  	0
 other democratic countries with unitary systems   such as france   japan   and sweden   have followed  similar path of decentralization  	0
 the last clause of article    section <num>   commonly referred to as the elastic clause or the necessary and proper cause   enables congress   to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying   out its constitutional responsibilities  	1

 to address this concern   congress passed and president clinton signed the defense of marriage act   doma   in <num>  	0

 the law also barred federal benefits for same   sex partners  	0
 the privileges and immunities clause of article iv asserts that states are prohibited from discriminating against out   of   staters by denying them such guarantees as access to courts   legal protection   property rights   and travel rights  	1

 to be more precise in their language   political scientists and legal experts make  distinction between civil liberties and civil rights   even though the constitution has been interpreted to protect both  	0
 we typically envision civil liberties as being limitations on government power   intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on  	1
 for example   the first amendment denies the government the power to prohibit   the free exercise   of religion   the states and the national government can not forbid people to follow  religion of their choice   even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided   blasphemous   or otherwise inappropriate  	0

 particularly in times of war   or even in response to threats against national security   the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts   often without access to lawyers or  defense   seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial  	0
 for example   during the civil war   president abraham lincoln detained suspected confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in union   controlled states and attempted to have them tried in military courts   leading the supreme court to rule in ex parte milligan that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating  	0

 hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous   because it would provide  pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such  list were not protected  	0
 later   james madison   in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the bill of rights   acknowledged another federalist argument     it has been said   that  bill of rights is not necessary   because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions  	0

 for that matter   the articles of confederation had not included  specific listing of rights either  	0
 ultimately   james madison delivered on this promise by proposing  package of amendments in the first congress   drawing from the declaration of rights in the virginia state constitution   suggestions from the ratification conventions   and other sources   which were extensively debated in both houses of congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states  	0
 ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite <num> percent of the states and became known as the bill of rights <link>  	1
 in the wake of the civil war   however   the prevailing thinking about the application of the bill of rights to the states changed  	0
 soon after slavery was abolished by the thirteenth amendment   state governments   particularly those in the former confederacy   began to pass   black codes   that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively relegated them to second   class citizenship under their state laws and constitutions  	1
 angered by these actions   members of the radical republican faction in congress demanded that the laws be overturned  	0
 legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years   some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire bill of rights   or at least the first eight amendments   to the states   while others have argued that only some rights are extended  	0

 the second provision of the fourteenth amendment that pertains to applying the bill of rights to the states is the due process clause   which says     nor shall any state deprive any person of life   liberty   or property   without due process of law  	0
 this provision is similar to the fifth amendment in that it also refers to   due process      term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials   or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process    	1
 although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically   the courts have held in  series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states  	0
 we can broadly divide the provisions of the bill of rights into three categories  	0
 the first   second   third   and fourth amendments protect basic individual freedoms   the fourth   partly     fifth   sixth   seventh   and eighth protect people suspected or accused of criminal activity   and the ninth and tenth   are consistent with the framers   view that the bill of rights is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all the rights people have and guarantees  role for state as well as federal government <link>  	0
 at the same time   public schooling was beginning to take root on  wide scale  	0
 since most states had traditional protestant majorities and most state officials were protestants themselves   the public school curriculum incorporated many protestant features   at times   these features would come into conflict with the beliefs of children from other christian sects or from other religious traditions  	0
 the establishment clause today tends to be interpreted  bit more broadly than in the past   it not only forbids the creation of    church of the united states   or   church of ohio   it also forbids the government from favoring one set of religious beliefs over others or favoring religion   of any variety   over non   religion  	0
 thus   the government can not promote   say   islamic beliefs over sikh beliefs or belief in god over atheism or agnosticism <link>  	0
 the free exercise clause   on the other hand   limits the ability of the government to control or restrict religious practices  	1
 this portion of the first amendment regulates not the government   promotion of religion   but rather government suppression of religious beliefs and practices  	0
 in the <num> and <num>   the court decided two cases in which it laid out  general test for deciding similar cases in the future  	0
 in both sherbert vverner    case dealing with unemployment compensation   and wisconsin vyoder   which dealt with the right of amish parents to homeschool their children   the court said that for  law to be allowed to limit or burden  religious practice   the government must meet two criteria  	0
 sherbert vverner   <num> us <num>   <num>     wisconsin vyoder   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 it must demonstrate both that it had    compelling governmental interest   in limiting that practice and that the restriction was   narrowly tailored  	1
 in other words   it must show there was  very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal  	1
 this standard became known as the sherbert test  	0
 but because it replaced the sherbert test with one that allowed more government regulation of religious practices   followers of other religious traditions grew concerned that state and local laws   even ones neutral on their face   might be used to curtail their religious practices  	0
 in <num>   in response to this decision   congress passed  law known as the religious freedom restoration act   rfra     which was followed in <num> by the religious land use and institutionalized persons act after part of the rfra was struck down by the supreme court  	0

 this same research also found that under term limits state legislators feel they have lost power relative to the governor and to various bureaucratic agency officials  	0
 see note above  	0
 this presumed loss of power could damage the state legislature   ability to adequately check the actions of the executive branch and to perform legislative functions   such as oversight  	0

 in <num>   theodore lowi argued that it was possible to categorize policy based upon the degree to which costs and benefits were concentrated on the few or diffused across the many  	0
 one policy category   known as distributive policy   tends to collect payments or resources from many but concentrates direct benefits on relatively few  	1
 while distributive policy   according to lowi   has diffuse costs and concentrated benefits   regulatory policy features the opposite arrangement   with concentrated costs and diffuse benefits  	1
  relatively small number of groups or individuals bear the costs of regulatory policy   but its benefits are expected to be distributed broadly across society  	0
  final type of policy is redistributive policy   so named because it redistributes resources in society from one group to another  	1
 that is   according to lowi   the costs are concentrated and so are the benefits   but different groups bear the costs and enjoy the benefits  	0

 at the more serious end of the foreign policy decision   making spectrum   and usually as  last resort when diplomacy fails   the us military and defense establishment exists to provide the united states the ability to wage war against other state and nonstate actors  	0
 such war can be offensive   as were the iraq war in <num> and the <num> removal of panamanian leader manuel noriega  	0
 or it can be defensive   as  means to respond to aggression from others   such as the persian gulf war in <num>   also known as operation desert storm <link>  	0

 these sharply focused foreign policy outputs tend to be exclusively the province of the president   including the deployment of troops and or intelligence agents in  crisis   executive summits between the president and other heads of state on targeted matters of foreign policy   presidential use of military force   and emergency funding measures to deal with foreign policy crises  	1
 these measures of foreign policy are more quickly enacted and demonstrate the   energy and dispatch   that alexander hamilton   writing in the federalist papers   saw as inherent in the institution of the presidency  	0
 emergency spending does involve congress through its power of the purse   but congress tends to give presidents what they need to deal with emergencies  	0
 probably the most extreme version of this potential dynamic occurred during the eisenhower presidency  	0
 when president dwight deisenhower used too many executive agreements instead of sending key ones to the senate as treaties   congress reacted by considering  constitutional amendment   the bricker amendment   that would have altered the treaty process as we know it  	0

 neoconservatives believe that rather than exercising restraint and always using international organizations as the path to international outcomes   the united states should aggressively use its might to promote its values and ideals around the world  	0

 all the states except rhode island chose delegates to send to the meeting    total of seventy men in all   but many did not attend  	0
 those who favored  nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it  permanent part of american society  	0
 the only decision that all could agree on was the election of george washington   the former commander of the continental army and hero of the american revolution   as the president of the convention  	0
 delegates from small states objected to this virginia plan  	0
 another proposal   the new jersey plan   called for  unicameral legislature with one house   in which each state would have one vote  	1
 thus   smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states  	0
 the first three articles divide the national government into three branches   congress   the executive branch   and the federal judiciary   and describe the powers and responsibilities of each  	0
 in article    ten sections describe the structure of congress   the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in congress   the length of congressional terms   and the powers of congress  	0
 the national legislature created by the article reflects the compromises reached by the delegates regarding such issues as representation   slavery   and national power  	0
 although debates over slavery and representation in congress occupied many at the convention   the chief concern was the challenge of increasing the authority of the national government while ensuring that it did not become too powerful  	0
 the framers resolved this problem through  separation of powers   dividing the national government into three separate branches and assigning different responsibilities to each one   as shown in <link>  	0
 they also created  system of checks and balances by giving each of three branches of government the power to restrict the actions of the others   thus requiring them to work together  	0
 the strongest guarantee that the power of the national government would be restricted and the states would retain  degree of sovereignty was the framers   creation of  federal system of government  	0
 in  federal system   power is divided between the federal   or national   government and the state governments  	1
 great or explicit powers   called enumerated powers   were granted to the federal government to declare war   impose taxes   coin and regulate currency   regulate foreign and interstate commerce   raise and maintain an army and  navy   maintain  post office   make treaties with foreign nations and with native american tribes   and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants  	1
 although the states retained  considerable degree of sovereignty   the supremacy clause in article vi of the constitution proclaimed that the constitution   laws passed by congress   and treaties made by the federal government were   the supreme law of the land  	0
 in the event of  conflict between the states and the national government   the national government would triumph  	0
 furthermore   although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the constitution   article  provided for the expansion of congressional powers if needed  	0
 but many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states  	0
 virginia   patrick henry   for example   feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man  	0
 he also disapproved of the federal government   new ability to tax its citizens  	0
 on the question of ratification   citizens quickly separated into two groups   federalists and anti   federalists  	0
 the federalists supported it  	0
 they tended to be among the elite members of society   wealthy and well   educated landowners   businessmen   and former military commanders who believed  strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth  	1
 the constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education   and article vi explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office  	0
 this caused many   like henry abbot of north carolina   to fear that government would be placed in the hands of   pagans  	0
  	0
 furthermore   tyranny could not arise in  government in which   the legislature necessarily predominates  	0
 finally   the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them   described as   personal motives     would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority  	1
 according to madison     ambition must be made to counteract ambition  	0

 division of power can also occur via  unitary structure or confederation <link>  	0
 in contrast to federalism    unitary system makes subnational governments dependent on the national government   where significant authority is concentrated  	1

 the constitution contains several provisions that direct the functioning of us federalism  	0
 some delineate the scope of national and state power   while others restrict it  	0
 what these anti   federalists sought was further assurance that the national government   capacity to act directly on behalf of the people would be restricted   which the first ten amendments   bill of rights   provided  	0
 the tenth amendment affirms the states   reserved powers     the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution   nor prohibited by it to the states   are reserved to the states respectively   or to the people  	1
 indeed   state constitutions had bills of rights   which the first congress used as the source for the first ten amendments to the constitution  	0
 like the federal government   the states can not violate personal freedoms by suspending the writ of habeas corpus   passing bills of attainder   or enacting ex post facto laws  	0
 furthermore   the fourteenth amendment   ratified in <num>   prohibits the states from denying citizens the rights to which they are entitled by the constitution   due process of law   or the equal protection of the laws  	1

 as the court observed     the government of the union   though limited in its powers   is supreme within its sphere of action and its laws   when made in pursuance of the constitution   form the supreme law of the land   maryland   action violated national supremacy because   the power to tax is the power to destroy  	0

 the new deal programs president franklin droosevelt proposed as  means to tackle the great depression ran afoul of the dual   federalism mindset of the justices on the supreme court in the <num>  	0
 the court struck down key pillars of the new deal   the national industrial recovery act and the agricultural adjustment act   for example   on the grounds that the federal government was operating in matters that were within the purview of the states  	0
 the court   obstructionist position infuriated roosevelt   leading him in <num> to propose  court   packing plan that would add one new justice for each one over the age of seventy   thus allowing the president to make  maximum of six new appointments  	0
 the new deal changed the relationship americans had with the national government  	0
 before the great depression   the government offered little in terms of financial aid   social benefits   and economic rights  	0
 after the new deal   it provided old   age pensions   social security     unemployment insurance   agricultural subsidies   protections for organizing in the workplace   and  variety of other public services created during roosevelt   administration  	1
 nowhere is this clearer than with respect to the social welfare and social insurance programs created during the new deal and great society eras   most of which are administered by both state and federal authorities and are jointly funded  	0
 the social security act of <num>   which created federal subsidies for state   administered programs for the elderly   people with handicaps   dependent mothers   and children   gave state and local officials wide discretion over eligibility and benefit levels  	1
 the unemployment insurance program   also created by the social security act   requires states to provide jobless benefits   but it allows them significant latitude to decide the level of tax to impose on businesses in order to fund the program as well as the duration and replacement rate of unemployment benefits  	1
 new federalism is premised on the idea that the decentralization of policies enhances administrative efficiency   reduces overall public spending   and improves policy outcomes  	1
 during nixon   administration   general revenue sharing programs were created that distributed funds to the state and local governments with minimal restrictions on how the money was spent  	0

 the national government has used grants to influence state actions as far back as the articles of confederation when it provided states with land grants  	0
 in the first half of the <num>   land grants were the primary means by which the federal government supported the states  	0
 block grants come with less stringent federal administrative conditions and provide recipients more flexibility over how to spend grant funds  	1
 examples of block grants include the workforce investment act program   which provides state and local agencies money to help youths and adults obtain skill sets that will lead to better   paying jobs   and the surface transportation program   which helps state and local governments maintain and improve highways   bridges   tunnels   sidewalks   and bicycle paths  	1
 finally   recipients of general revenue sharing faced the least restrictions on the use of federal grants  	0
 however   congressional efforts to convert aid to families with dependent children   afdc   to  block grant succeeded  	0
 the temporary assistance for needy families   tanf   block grant replaced the afdc in <num>   marking the first time the federal government transformed an entitlement program   which guarantees individual rights to benefits   into  block grant  	0

 for example   title vi of the civil rights act of <num> authorizes the federal government to withhold federal grants as well as file lawsuits against state and local officials for practicing racial discrimination  	1

 federalism also comes with drawbacks  	0

 in writing the declaration of independence in <num>   thomas jefferson drew on the ideas of john locke to express the colonists   belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects  	0
 it was  scathing legal indictment of king george iii for violating the colonists   liberties  	0
 indeed   the federalists did include in the constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens   based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both british kings and parliaments as well as royal governors  	0
 in article    section <num>   the constitution limits the power of congress in three ways   prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder   prohibiting ex post facto laws   and limiting the ability of congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus  	0
 finally   the writ of habeas corpus is used in our common   law legal system to demand that  neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained  	1
 particularly in times of war   or even in response to threats against national security   the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts   often without access to lawyers or  defense   seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial  	0
 the federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of congress   along with the limitations on those powers in article    section <num>   would suffice   and no separate bill of rights was needed  	0
 alexander hamilton   writing as publius in federalist no <num>   argued that the constitution was   merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation     rather than to concern itself with   the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns  	0
 hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous   because it would provide  pretext for people to claim that rights not included in such  list were not protected  	0
 the anti   federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in article    section <num>   of the constitution would allow congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the constitution   authors   thus   they held that  bill of rights was necessary  	0

 this provision is similar to the fifth amendment in that it also refers to   due process      term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials   or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process    	1
 beginning in <num>   the supreme court has found that various provisions of the bill of rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states   even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the bill of rights does   or at all  	0
 this means there has been  process of selective incorporation of the bill of rights into the practices of the states   in other words   the constitution effectively inserts parts of the bill of rights into state laws and constitutions   even though it does   do so explicitly  	0

 defining obscenity has been something of  challenge for the courts   supreme court justice potter stewart famously said of obscenity   having watched pornography in the supreme court building      know it when  see it  	0
 into the early twentieth century   written work was frequently banned as being obscene   including works by noted authors such as james joyce and henry miller   although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone  	0
 in <num>   the supreme court established the miller test for deciding whether something is obscene          whether the average person   applying contemporary community standards   would find that the work   taken as  whole   appeals to the prurient interest        whether the work depicts or describes   in  patently offensive way   sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law   and      whether the work   taken as  whole   lacks serious literary   artistic   political   or scientific value  	1

 in addition to protecting the personal freedoms of individuals   the bill of rights protects those suspected or accused of crimes from various forms of unfair or unjust treatment  	0
 the prominence of these protections in the bill of rights may seem surprising  	0
 the most notable is that it prohibits  second prosecution only at the same level of government   federal or state   as the first   the federal government can try you for violating federal law   even if  state or local court finds you not guilty of the same action  	0

 we saw above that james madison and the other framers were aware they might endanger some rights if they listed  few in the constitution and omitted others  	0
 to ensure that those interpreting the constitution would recognize that the listing of freedoms and rights in the bill of rights was not exhaustive   the ninth amendment states  	0
 although the term privacy does not appear in the constitution or bill of rights   scholars have interpreted several bill of rights provisions as an indication that james madison and congress sought to protect  common   law right to privacy as it would have been understood in the late eighteenth century    right to be free of government intrusion into our personal life   particularly within the bounds of the home  	1
 for example   we could perhaps see the second amendment as standing for the common   law right to self   defense in the home   the third amendment as  statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone   home   the fourth amendment as setting  high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone   home   and the due process and takings clauses of the fifth amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government   taking  home or property   reinforced after the civil war by the fourteenth amendment    	0

 in the united states   many advocates of civil liberties are concerned that laws such as the usa patriot act      uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act     passed weeks after the <num> <num> attacks in <num>   have given the federal government too much power by making it easy for officials to seek and obtain search warrants or   in some cases   to bypass warrant requirements altogether  	0
 critics have argued that the patriot act has largely been used to prosecute ordinary criminals   in particular drug dealers   rather than terrorists as intended  	0
 most european countries   at least on paper   have opted for laws that protect against such government surveillance   perhaps mindful of past experience with communist and fascist regimes  	0
 unless the person or group challenging the law can prove otherwise   the courts will generally decide the discriminatory practice is allowed  	0
 in these cases   the courts are applying the rational basis test  	0

 discrimination against members of racial   ethnic   or religious groups or those of various national origins is reviewed to the greatest degree by the courts   which apply the strict scrutiny standard in these cases  	0
 under strict scrutiny   the burden of proof is on the government to demonstrate that there is  compelling governmental interest in treating people from one group differently from those who are not part of that group   the law or action can be   narrowly tailored   to achieve the goal in question   and that it is the   least restrictive means   available to achieve that goal  	0

 why do we have two parties  	0
 the two   party system came into being because the structure of us elections   with one seat tied to  geographic district   tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties  	0
 even when there are other options on the ballot   most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even  single office  	0

 one of the first challenges facing the party   in   government   or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office   is to achieve their policy goals  	1
 the means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties   republican meetings are called party conferences and democrat meetings are called party caucuses  	1

 the first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is  party   in   government phenomenon driven by  decades   long sorting of the voting public   or  change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position  	0
 morris fiorina     americans have not become more politically polarized     the washington post   <num> june <num>  	0
 according to the sorting thesis   before the <num>   voters were mostly concerned with state   level party positions rather than national party concerns  	0
 since parties are bottom   up institutions   this meant local issues dominated elections   it also meant national   level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics  	0
 before then   it was common for many states to practice redistricting   or redrawing of their electoral maps   only if they gained or lost seats in the us house of representatives  	1
 this can happen once every ten years as  result of  constitutionally mandated reapportionment process   in which the number of house seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes  	0
 according to political scientist nolan mccarty   there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone  	0

 however   because he did not win the majority   more than half   of the available electoral votes   the election was decided by the house of representatives   as required by the twelfth amendment  	0

 membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns   or who want to be with others who share their views  	0

 on the other hand   public interest groups attempt to promote public   or collective   goods  	0
 such collective goods are benefits   tangible or intangible   that help most or all citizens  	1
 these goods are often produced collectively   and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society   they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement  	0
 group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems  	0

 joining interest groups can help facilitate civic engagement   which allows people to feel more connected to the political and social community  	0
 some interest groups develop as grassroots movements   which often begin from the bottom up among  small number of people at the local level  	1
 interest groups can amplify the voices of such individuals through proper organization and allow them to participate in ways that would be less effective or even impossible alone or in small numbers  	0

 of all the political thinkers who influenced american beliefs about government   the most important is surely john locke <link>  	0
 the most significant contributions of locke    seventeenth   century english philosopher   were his ideas regarding the relationship between government and natural rights   which were believed to be god   given rights to life   liberty   and property  	0
 people sacrificed  small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government   protection of their lives   liberty   and property  	1

 fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another   however   the framers of the articles of confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by  weak central government  	0
 one of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose taxes  	0

 neither of these branches had existed under the articles of confederation  	0
 thus   congress can pass laws   but its power to do so can be checked by the president   who can veto potential legislation so that it can not become  law  	0

 thus   states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce   commerce within the borders of  state   and marriage  	0
 this approach to ratification was an unusual one  	0
 since the authority inherent in the articles of confederation and the confederation congress had rested on the consent of the states   changes to the nation   government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures  	0

 responding to charges by anti   federalists that the constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals   the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for american citizens  	0
 james madison    member of congress from virginia   took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the constitution  	0
 the bill of rights was intended to quiet the fears of anti   federalists that the constitution did not adequately protect individual liberties and thus encourage their support of the new national government  	1
 many of these first ten amendments were based on provisions of the english bill of rights and the virginia declaration of rights  	0
 for example   the right to bear arms for protection   second amendment     the right not to have to provide shelter and provision for soldiers in peacetime   third amendment     the right to  trial by jury   sixth and seventh amendments     and protection from excessive fines and from cruel and unusual punishment   eighth amendment   are taken from the english bill of rights  	0
 other liberties   however   do not derive from british precedents  	0
 the protections for religion   speech   the press   and assembly that are granted by the first amendment did not exist under english law  	0
   the right to petition the government did   however  	0
 the supreme court   for example   has held that the ninth amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right  	1
 the tenth amendment   one of the first submitted to the states for ratification   ensures that states possess all powers not explicitly assigned to the federal government by the constitution  	1
 this guarantee protects states   reserved powers to regulate such things as marriage   divorce   and intrastate transportation and commerce   and to pass laws affecting education and public health and safety  	0
 in  time of crisis   like  severe economic depression   the president needed to take office almost immediately after being elected   and modern transportation allowed the new president to travel to the nation   capital quicker than before  	0

 in  confederation   authority is decentralized   and the central government   ability to act depends on the consent of the subnational governments  	0
 under the articles of confederation   the first constitution of the united states     states were sovereign and powerful while the national government was subordinate and weak  	1
 because states were reluctant to give up any of their power   the national government lacked authority in the face of challenges such as servicing the war debt   ending commercial disputes among states   negotiating trade agreements with other countries   and addressing popular uprisings that were sweeping the country  	0

 the framers of the constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties   most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats  	0
 prohibition of such laws means that the us congress can not simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes  	0
 an ex post facto law has  retroactive effect   it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed   or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact  	0
 debate has always swirled over these issues  	0
 the federalists reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of congress   along with the limitations on those powers in article    section <num>   would suffice   and no separate bill of rights was needed  	0
 alexander hamilton   writing as publius in federalist no  	0
 however   the anti   federalists argued that the federalists   position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere  	0
 the anti   federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in article    section <num>   of the constitution would allow congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the constitution   authors   thus   they held that  bill of rights was necessary  	0
 in the decades following the constitution   ratification   the supreme court declined to expand the bill of rights to curb the power of the states   most notably in the <num> case of barron vbaltimore barron vbaltimore   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 in this case   which dealt with property rights under the fifth amendment   the supreme court unanimously decided that the bill of rights applied only to actions by the federal government  	1
 explaining the court   ruling   chief justice john marshall wrote that it was incorrect to argue that   the constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments   as well as against that which might be attempted by their   federal   government  	0
 in the short term   they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes  	0
 their long   term solution was to propose two amendments to the constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites   these rights became the fourteenth amendment   which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general   and the fifteenth amendment   which protected the right to vote in particular <link>  	1
 but   the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to native americans  	0
 with the ratification of the fourteenth amendment in <num>   civil liberties gained more clarification  	0
 first   the amendment says     no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states     which is  provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in article iv   section <num>   of the original constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens  	0
   to use an example from today   the punishment for speeding by an out   of   state driver can not be more severe than the punishment for an in   state driver    	0
 although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically   the courts have held in  series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that can not be denied by the states  	0
 for example   in sherbert vverner   <num>     the supreme court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down  job because it required working on the sabbath  	0
 sherbert vverner   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 when the supreme court initially decided in <num> that the second amendment protects an individual   right to keep and bear arms   it did not decide then that it was  fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well  	0
 it was only in the mcdonald vchicago case two years later that the supreme court incorporated the second amendment into state law  	0
 another area in which the supreme court gradually moved to incorporate the bill of rights regards censorship and the fourteenth amendment  	0
 the first amendment is perhaps the most famous provision of the bill of rights   it is arguably also the most extensive   because it guarantees both religious freedoms and the right to express your views in public  	0

 the key question that faces the courts is whether the establishment clause should be understood as imposing   in thomas jefferson   words      wall of separation between church and state   in  <num> case known as lemon vkurtzman   the supreme court established the lemon test for deciding whether  law or other government action that might promote  particular religious practice should be allowed to stand lemon vkurtzman   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 the lemon test has three criteria that must be satisfied for such  law or action to be found constitutional and remain in effect  	0
 the rights of conscientious objectors   individuals who claim the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought   conscience   or religion   have also been controversial   although many conscientious objectors have contributed service as non   combatant medics during wartime  	0
 to avoid serving in the vietnam war   many people claimed to have  conscientious objection to military service on the basis that they believed this particular war was unwise or unjust  	0
 in both sherbert vverner    case dealing with unemployment compensation   and wisconsin vyoder   which dealt with the right of amish parents to homeschool their children   the court said that for  law to be allowed to limit or burden  religious practice   the government must meet two criteria sherbert vverner   <num> us <num>   <num>     wisconsin vyoder   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 it must demonstrate both that it had    compelling governmental interest   in limiting that practice and that the restriction was   narrowly tailored  	0
 in other words   it must show there was  very good reason for the law in question and that the law was the only feasible way of achieving that goal  	0
 this standard became known as the sherbert test  	0
 since the burden of proof in these cases was on the government   the supreme court made it very difficult for the federal and state governments to enforce laws against individuals that would infringe upon their religious beliefs  	0
 such  conflict emerged in the <num> supreme court case known as burwell vhobby lobby  	0
 burwell vhobby lobby stores   inc  <num> us       <num>    	0
 the hobby lobby chain of stores sells arts and crafts merchandise at hundreds of stores   its founder   david green   is  devout fundamentalist christian whose beliefs include opposition to abortion and contraception  	0
 consistent with these beliefs   he used his business to object to  provision of the patient protection and affordable care act   aca or obamacare   requiring employer   backed insurance plans to include no   charge access to the morning   after pill    form of emergency contraception   arguing that this requirement infringed on his conscience  	0
 although the remainder of the first amendment protects four distinct rights   free speech   press   assembly   and petition   we generally think of these rights today as encompassing  right to freedom of expression   particularly since the world   technological evolution has blurred the lines between oral and written communication      speech and press   in the centuries since the first amendment was written and adopted  	0
 one such person was gregory lee johnson    member of various pro   communist and antiwar groups  	0
 in <num>   as part of  protest near the republican national convention in dallas   texas   johnson set fire to  us flag that another protestor had torn from  flagpole  	0
 freedom of the press is an important component of the right to free expression as well  	0
 in near vminnesota   an early case regarding press freedoms   the supreme court ruled that the government generally could not engage in prior restraint   that is   states and the federal government could not in advance prohibit someone from publishing something without  very compelling reason near vminnesota   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0
 this standard was reinforced in <num> in the pentagon papers case   in which the supreme court found that the government could not prohibit the new york times and washington post newspapers from publishing the pentagon papers  	0
 new york times covunited states   <num> us <num>   <num>    	0

 more specifically   the papers were compiled at the request of secretary of defense robert mcnamara and provided  study of us political and military involvement in vietnam from <num> to <num>  	0
 although people who leak secret information to the media can still be prosecuted and punished   this does not generally extend to reporters and news outlets that pass that information on to the public  	0
 the edward snowden case is another good case in point  	0
 another key exception to the right to freedom of expression is obscenity   acts or statements that are extremely offensive under current societal standards  	0
 defining obscenity has been something of  challenge for the courts   supreme court justice potter stewart famously said of obscenity   having watched pornography in the supreme court building      know it when  see it  	0
 into the early twentieth century   written work was frequently banned as being obscene   including works by noted authors such as james joyce and henry miller   although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone  	0
 in <num>   the supreme court established the miller test for deciding whether something is obscene          whether the average person   applying contemporary community standards   would find that the work   taken as  whole   appeals to the prurient interest        whether the work depicts or describes   in  patently offensive way   sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law   and      whether the work   taken as  whole   lacks serious literary   artistic   political   or scientific value  	0

 however   the application of this standard has at times been problematic  	0
 furthermore   the courts have ruled that   although public school officials are government actors   the first amendment freedom of expression rights of children attending public schools are somewhat limited  	0
 in particular   in tinker vdes moines   <num>   and hazelwood vkuhlmeier   <num>     the supreme court has upheld restrictions on speech that creates   substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others  	0

 before the civil war   this would have been  nearly meaningless distinction  	0
 in most states at that time   white males of military age were considered part of the militia   liable to be called for service to put down rebellions or invasions   and the right   to keep and bear arms   was considered  common   law right inherited from english law that predated the federal and state constitutions  	0
 the constitution was not seen as  limitation on state power   and since the states expected all able   bodied free men to keep arms as  matter of course   what gun control there was mostly revolved around ensuring slaves   and their abolitionist allies   did   have guns  	0
 however   in <num>   in  narrow <num>   <num> decision on district of columbia vheller   the supreme court found that at least some gun control laws did violate the second amendment and that this amendment does protect an individual   right to keep and bear arms   at least in some circumstances   in particular     for traditionally lawful purposes   such as self   defense within the home  	0
 district of columbia et alvheller   <num> us <num>   <num>     <num>  	0
 because the district of columbia is not  state   this decision immediately applied the right only to the federal government and territorial governments  	0
 the fourth amendment sits at the boundary between general individual freedoms and the rights of those suspected of crimes  	0

 what happens if the police conduct an illegal search or seizure without  warrant and find evidence of  crime  	0
 in the <num> supreme court case mapp vohio   the court decided that evidence obtained without  warrant that did   fall under one of the exceptions mentioned above could not be used as evidence in  state criminal trial   giving rise to the broad application of what is known as the exclusionary rule   which was first established in <num> on  federal level in weeks vunited states  	0

 for instance   abraham lincoln won the presidency in <num> even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race  	0
 after the election is over   supporters experience remorse when their least   favorite candidate wins instead  	0
 for example   in the <num> election   ralph nader ran for president as the candidate of the green party  	0
 nader    longtime consumer activist concerned with environmental issues and social justice   attracted many votes from people who usually voted for democratic candidates  	0
 electoral rules are probably not the only reason the united states has  two   party system  	0
 we need only look at the number of parties in the british or canadian systems   both of which are winner   take   all plurality systems like that in the united states   to see that it is possible to have more than two parties while still directly electing representatives  	0

 at its most basic level   being  member of the party   in   the   electorate simply means  voter is more likely to voice support for  party  	0
 these voters are often called party identifiers   since they usually represent themselves in public as being members of  party   and they may attend some party events or functions  	0
 party identifiers are also more likely to provide financial support for the candidates of their party during election season  	0
 second   the state organization is also responsible for drafting  state platform that serves as  policy guide for partisans who are eventually selected to public office  	0

 before then   it was common for many states to practice redistricting   or redrawing of their electoral maps   only if they gained or lost seats in the us house of representatives  	0
 this can happen once every ten years as  result of  constitutionally mandated reapportionment process   in which the number of house seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes  	0
 several states therefore had to make dramatic changes to their electoral maps during the next two redistricting cycles   <num>   <num> and <num>   <num>    	0
 map designers   no longer certain how to protect individual party members   changed tactics to try and create safe seats so members of their party could be assured of winning by  comfortable margin  	0
 the basic rule of thumb was that designers sought to draw districts in which their preferred party had  <num> percent or better chance of winning  given district   regardless of which candidate the party nominated  	0
 that is where political parties come in  	0
 essentially   political parties are groups of people with similar interests who work together to create and implement policies  	1

 on the other hand   public interest groups attempt to promote public   or collective   goods  	0
 such collective goods are benefits   tangible or intangible   that help most or all citizens  	0
 the answer is that they likely prefer to do something else and realize they can receive the same grade as the rest of the group without contributing to the effort  	1
 this result is often termed the free rider problem   because some individuals can receive benefits   get  free ride   without helping to bear the cost  	1

 in this proposed two   chamber congress   states with larger populations would have more representatives in each chamber  	0
 the bicameral system established at the constitutional convention and still followed today requires the two houses to pass identical bills   or proposed items of legislation  	0

 an enumerated power is  power explicitly stated in the constitution  	1
 an implied power is one not specifically detailed in the constitution but inferred as necessary to achieve the objectives of the national government  	1

 each of these powers also grants congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration   that is   the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch  	0
 the fact that congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce  	0
